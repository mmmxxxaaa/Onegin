A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
A Russian household simple quite,
A Vampire fond of meditation,
A ball here, there a children's treat,
A ball in Peter's capital,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
A beauty languidly at rest,
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A book at early morn perused.
A bottle of a vintage white
A box of terrible import.
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
A canine face with horns thereon,
A careless looker-on estranged
A case of books he doth obtain—
A charm with it in conversation.
A child devoid of childishness
A constant harping on one tune,
A coquette loves by calculation,
A countenance perplexed and scared.
A country damsel's album trim,
A crab upon a spider rides,
A critic of the stage malicious,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
A curious interest disclose
A dagger, asterisk, or note
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
A dinner, whimsical each course,
A double force unto their song
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A due which must to earth be paid.
A duellist of classic mind,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A dying man with art to soothe,
A feeble version read below,
A few of different temper deemed,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A finished madrigal would frame
A flimsy trace of musings past
A fond and careful mother been.
A fop, in dress pedantical.
A forest now she sees in front
A fragile bridge and insecure,
A friar black approaching near,
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A game of chess would often play,
A garden by a shining rill.
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
A gust of passion never tore
A hand of ice appeared to seize
A happy destiny ordained:
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
A hermit's life Onéguine led,
A hidden meaning could impart,
A hidden train of wild desire.
A horse's hoofs she hears—She shrinks!
A hundred times will not repeat,
A jolly song and distant horn;
A joyous troop of little boys
A kerchief round her silver hair
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
A letter for her hero meant:
A life in common with the rest;
A life of fact, not fiction, led—
A little Juvenal to spout,
A little farther please to read
A little virgin mirror peeps.
A load of care upon the maid.
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A love which knew no limitation,
A lover's letter might convey,
A maid hath oft, may yet again
A marriageable maid matured,
A mild quotation to translate,
A million bipeds reckons thus
A modern Regulus unchained,
A moment effervescing stirs,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A new proprietor arrived,
A new world was made manifest!
A noted fop who gambled hard.
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
A pair of bullets—nought beside—
A pair; though desolate my mind,
A paragon of virtue he!
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
A philosophic anchorite:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
A print without the picture's grace,
A promenade in twilight late
A register of fleeting thought,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
A rivulet beneath them shoots
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
A Russian poem's mechanism
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
A bastard fame prohibited?
A bearded postillion astride
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
A breathless silence then, prolonged—
A certain little escapade
A door he opens. But why shrank
A faithful model she appeared
A first success light pinions gave,
A lady draws the hostess near,
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
A maiden's secrets—of the heart.
A mansion—by the window, see!
A mien unaltered she preserved,
A notoriety proclaimed,
A passionate desire to bend
A pensive sorrow in her glance
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
A prudent man like you and brave
A scant attendance Lenski showed
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
A sense of social delight,
A shape half cat and half a crane.
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
A simple tombstone hath been set.
A single being: 'twas in fine
A slave of actresses capricious,
A smile from slumbering nature clear
A something somehow have obtained,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
A sportsman who in covert lies.
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
A strong resemblance these possess—
A substitute for lamps we hail!
A table to the fire is brought,
A tangled wilderness around.
A tender couplet he combined,
A thick immense neglected grove
A timid love to banishment?—
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
A true account and in detail.
A valuable hostage gained,
A very troublesome disease,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
A village and beneath, a wood,
A vision desolate and drear
A visionary mortified,
A visionary personage
A weary season was at hand—
A while ago the winter spent,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A white and undulating pall
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
A windmill too a jig performs
A wish from place to place to roam,
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
A young and handsome galliard.
A young Armida's lips to press,
A young man motionless he saw,
Abandon cities riotous,
"Abandon hope for ever here!”
Abandoned he his country seat,
Abandoning insane delight,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
About the rain and flax and cattle.”—
Above the ashes of the dead.
Above the humble urn of death.
Above the yawning grave would fight,—
Absorbed in melancholy mood
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Accents of rapture or despair
Acquaintance instantly to make.
Across her youth a shade had come,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Address to you one single phrase
Adieu she to the matron said
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Adorned with many a vision bright
Adroitly seized and carried her;
"Advance!”—Indifferent and sedate,
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Affection how did you requite?
Affectionately yours till death.
After the wedded couple strain;
Again a century should scourge
Again her rural life she sought,
Again imagination blazed,
Again in her ethereal dance?
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
Again the plague of boyhood—love?
Against my inclination, friends,
Age immature averse to cheat—
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Ah! I'm so weak—my throbbing breast!
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Ah! he has gone the other way”—
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
Ah! it may be, affection true
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”—
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Akulka who was once Celine,
"Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
Alarm the winter journey gave.
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Alas! for now before her passed
Alas! he loved as in our times
Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!”
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
Alas! my stomach it betrays
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Alas! the friend of childish days
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Alas! with merited reproach.
Albums magnificent which scare
Alike by sighs and flattery.
"Aline!”
All Nature winter seemed to await,
All about Olga—to a light
All are amazed; but Lenski he
All are constrained and fetters bear,
All arise. To the door he goes.
All breathless and without replies.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
All covered up with snow in heaps,
All dark and silent hath become;
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
All in the good old style appears,
All is foreseen. My secret drear
All mothers their sweet girls believed
All overtures of friendship ended.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
All silently hung down his head.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
All so distinct, and all so white!
All sons of mental weariness.
All that a poet could desire,
All that industrial London brings
All that perfection could desire;
All that the heart would fain express—
All the creations which below
All the young people round about,
All this I know is out of date,
All this in many cases brings
All this may be an empty dream,
All this was novel to Eugene.
All this, my friends, translate aright:
All to the doctors Eugene send,
All to the grand saloon are gone—
All vanished as an echo goes.
All visited him at first, of course;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
All with urbanity betray,
Allure the young gallant
Almost became a poet say—
Alone amid possessions great,
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Alone within his habitation
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Along the hall, and high above
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
Already by repentance moved
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Already dance to song proceeds;
Already he grew phthisical.
Already sings the nightingale.
Also my wretched liberty
Also one Viázemski, remarking
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Also their feet—yet ne'ertheless
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Also, to equalise the scales,
Although her book did not contain
Although it will not bear translation,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
Although we know that Eugene had
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Always together, eventide
Am I to go through the whole list?”
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
Amid a serious disputation,
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Amid submissive herds of men
Amid the awful emptiness
Amid the company career.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Amid the soulless sons of pride
Amidst successes flattering
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
An almanac but eight years old.
An ancient lady full of grace.—
An ardent heart and yet so mild?—
An ear to my confession lend;
An ever transcendental flight;
An exile from their troublous reign,
An explanation: she was scared,
An honourable course ye took,
An hour passed by—another—till,
An idle anchorite and sad,
An infant maiden doth exhort
An inn at every stage erect.
An innate love of meditation,
An invalid from lung complaint.
An oval countenance and pink,
And "Agathon” replied, amazed.
And (elbows on the table) they
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
And Limburg cheese alive and old
And a guitar produced we see,
And after Albion's proud lyre
And all with one accord agreed,
And also fashionable beaux.
And also that my feeble verse—
And at economy was great;
And at the altar of their fame
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
And beckon to the passing sails.
And bless mankind with full delight.
And both of dull existence tired,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And by a sweet delusion he
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
And cool sagacious mind he had:
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
And due precautions take betimes.
And ease and fashionable waste,—
And ease the tortures of the heart—
And Eugene soon discovered there
And every morning I awake
And fields my joys have ever been;
And finally he deigns let fall
And following them ye might espy
And from his dressing-room would pass
And from the Millionaya afar
And from the country all around
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
And grasp a stirrup fortunate—
And hastened to his uncle's side,
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar”
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And a new diadem supplied.
And a romance in ancient style
And after them at headlong pace
And agitate my heart again;
And all without her husband's leave.
And an elegiac poem wrote.
And an habitual sense of pain;
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
And cannot anything conceal,
And care but little for its ends.
And cares not farther to proceed;
And consolation soon begot.
And courtier, fop, and usurer
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
And cry: he was a poet great!
And dark and drear the evenings were,
And death before the husband wide
And deem the world perfection is!
And distance interposed in vain,
And education runs to waste,
And Eugene ever in her soul
And Fliànoff, pensioned councillor,
And I admired their common sense
And I confess that now-a-days
And I, remembering Svetlana,
And a boy handed round the cream.
And a determined disposition,
And a malicious epigram
And all in snow is buried deep.
And all the joys which Winter knows.
And all thy precious elegies,
And all your love on self bestow;
And an enchanting shoulder shines
And barely visible the smoke
And be as happy—as I might.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
And bitter torment never known.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
And buried deep in meditation,
And by the world repeated oft,
And clad in airy costume took
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And disappear in space; then she
And every year distributed
And eye which gleams with inspiration—
And freezing fits of weariness.
And from the misty woodland nigh
And full of innocent delight,
And gallicisms I love as well
And gave himself but little pain
And gently hovered o'er my head?
And gossip of the town and fashion
And gradually day unfolds.
And grown more curious by far
And had with waddling in the end
And handsome countenance combined,
And harmony was soon restored.
And hated casual visitors,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
And her upon the threshold laid.
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
And herds of oxen wandering low;
And honestly 'tis my belief
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
And husbands' tedious amity?
And impiously should declare,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
And in addition youth is flame
And in her conversation drawled.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
And in her native language she
And in reality one day
And in the Summer Garden rove.
And in the bathroom did command
And in the final tome we learnt,
And in the frosty night alone
And in the morning doth not know
And irrigate them with champagne;
And isolated from all men,
And judgment which unsteady veers
And leads a solitary life?
And leans upon the monster's arm,
And led me off to church with song.”
And Lenski followed—a light broke—
And a grand festival proceeds.
And a half rubles down gave she;
And alphabetically tries
And at the table sat her down.
And be not in advance severe.
And can it be? But late a child
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
And comfort of each country dame,
And endless the cotillon seemed
And fashion's gay frivolities;
And female tears hysterical,
And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
And I to give thee cakes was wont?”—
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
And all the three to breakfast went;
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
And his strange conduct at the dance
And hot with jealous indignation,
And if Tattiana mine had found—
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
And lessons to his children read.
And life and fate in turn selected
And like Childe Harold gloomily
And like Napoleons each of us
And like his shadow dogged his life,
And like the prisoner's our delight
And lo! he is already there!
And long internal agitation
And long perukes hath vanishèd.
And love's delicious diadem
And loves you as—a relative!
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
And many a caravan on high
And many a day thereafter laid
And many another slily sneered;
And marking Tania's agitation,
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
And may fall headlong any time.
And mental elasticity.
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
And more imagination teems.
And my Eugene the path must trace—
And my dark soul to light was brought;
And naked uniformity.
And natural benevolence,
And never hath our language proud
And no ridiculous report,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
And nothing more important sees;
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
And now his youthful heart desires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now she skips and now she spring
And now we hear delightedly
And o'er the granite coping bent,
And of the attic. Honestly,
And of the irksome harness tires,
And oft at eventide a throng
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
And oh! what verses, what delights,
And on the footstool sitting down
And on the last one, underlined:
And others rise ephemeral!
And ought he not to disregard
And our successors soon shall drive
And overcome antipathies
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
And pelt him with cherries,
And physic bring with mournful face,
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
And pressed her hand—the crimson blush
And privileges nice allowed,
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
And saying this Vladimir drained
And scanned in silence its content.
And Schiller read by candlelight.
And a long time about her talked.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
And about dawn upon his breast
And all that from thy hand proceeds—
And an old gent the poet marking
And ancient usages observed
And at the stages bugs and fleas
And blest the shadows of the night.
And blush to own himself reflect.
And by that shady rivulet
And contemplative dreaminess;
And dames of fine organisations,
And enmity and hope and love—
And exclamations and good cheer.
And exclamations interlaced.
And fashionable magazines,
And finally, upon his bed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
And flooded all the level ground.
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And form a network left and right;
And glasses unemployed all night;
And glittering simpletons beside;
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And grant his weary bones their rest
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
"And he—but of him presently—
And heedless of approval seems,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
And his poor basten sandal knits.
And homeward like an arrow tore.
And hurried home his awful freight.
And in her languid bosom raise
And irritates the appetite.
And is all light within destroyed?
And is it true and not a jest,
And is it true her garland bright
And kindness Tania was impressed,
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
And like a palisade flit by.
And linen on him doth bestow.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And lonely through the forest creeps.”
And long her eyes as through a haze
And make a dark existence shine
And meditative from the spot
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
And Tania's husband soon appeared.—
And aimless journeys did commence—
And an encouragement did breathe
And as a country damsel roved,
And better, if I judge aright;
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
And by a partial temper stirred
And by degrees upon him grew
And devastate the woods around.
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
And dost thou know her?”—"We live near.”
And far removed from rumour vain;
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And fled afar—she followed me.
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
And for a time our course delay,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
And gallops to her house away.
And grant success to labour long;
And happy unto you appear.
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And hates the world's discordant ways.
And he had made her heart beat quick!
And heard a voice cry—Why! He's killed!—
And in a whisper did repeat:
And in her hand a French romance.
And in society might shed
"And is it long since back he came?
"And is it she? It must be—no—
"And is it,” meditates Eugene.
And it may be a secret dread
And jests doth recapitulate.
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And like a shadow haunted her.
And meditative homeward goes,
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
And my Tattiana now began
And my romance's open theme
And necessary fools allowed.
And never was the ear affright
And now he views forgotten foes,
And now upon the snow in thaw
And now, I mournfully confess,
And numerous pages had preserved
And oft in whispers would impart
And our swift troikas never tire;
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
And past the threshold of decay,
And platitudes and pedantry,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
And reads with rapid eager eye
And rest from bygone days of strife.
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn—
And secretly their views expound.
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
And sermon—but in that dread hour
And shall adopt some new caprice.
And she at last hath us deceived;
And she despite herself would waste
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
And shorter had the days become.
And showed with an uncertain light
And shut him in a lonely nook.
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And silently I here must die—
And since I pulled thee by the ear—
And slowly life coagulates—
And so—God bless them, if He list.
And so Tattiana was her name,
And so departed. But Eugene,
And so my noon hath come! If so,
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
And sometimes into snares as well
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
And soon Onéguine's door beside
And soon imagination threw
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And spouted it with lyric fire—
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
And starting suddenly doth say:
And stay whose length none recollects.
And still the coachmen round the fires
And stoves of various shapes abound.
And straight returning whence he came,
And stupid censors passionate;
And such unconsciously he led,
And sulked in silent indignation;
And supercilious dames she glides,
And supper. In the country we
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
And tears of reconciliation:
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
And testy gamesters do engage
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And that no longer could inspire.
And that too often we receive
And that unrivalled paragon,
And the Skatènines, aged pair,
And the attendants called in haste.
And the bad book accompanies.
And the cast-iron statuette
And the cold beauties of the season:
And the conviction soon arose,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And the eternal lorgnette through
And the extent of his caprice;
And the fair sex as light as down!
And the far mountains daintily
And the heart's agitated dreams.
And the kind-hearted servitors:
And the lime alley's twilight dim
And the lone secret of her heart,
And the more surely we ensnare
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And the recesses of my mind
And the sagacious Triquet back
And the saloon threw open wide;
And the suspicious veteran old,
And the world met her smilingly,
And the young damsel from the town,
And the young girl appeared before
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And the young revellers of past times
And then "monsieur” supplied her place;
And then a cup of coffee drank,
And then made merry pope and guest,
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
And then the stanzas of my theme
And then to meditate for days
And then with blind credulity
And these the attentive maid observed
And they the waters recommend.
And think: here lies who loved me well,
And this fifth canto ought to be
And this the faithful one allows,
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
And thou, persistent to the end,
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
And though I read it with distress,
And though her soul might be confused,
And though perchance a lady may
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
And through the lofty windows views
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
And thus he never fell among
And thus he spent eight years of time,
And thus in season the rich field
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
And thus secures the prey we seek.
And thus unto her nurse did say:
And thy inebriating wave
And thy protection I implore.
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And to Onéguine far away
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
And to the field of honour led;
And to these letters and these tears.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
And traces with a slender finger
And triumphs in career erotic.
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
And turned aside the drapery;
And turned to leave immediately,
And two old pines their branches spread—
And unto whom we all allude
And usually despised it too),
And vanish like a bird in air.
And various chords upon it proves,
And vehemently though amazed
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
And views amongst themselves advance
And visit many a foreign clime,
And vows will probably be signed:
And wakened him with the loud cry:
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
And we—an unattractive set—
And well-instructed to betray!
And what from its recess appears?
And what like menaces fatigues,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
And what she from the cards inferred.
And what the old man might bequeath.
And what will Destiny concede?”
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
And when her violence reviewed—
And when the watery mirror gleamed
And where at last his bones repose
And where may be her sister now?
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And where Thalia softly dreams
And where a madrigal occurs
And where the admirable streams
And where the billows hoarsely raise
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And who the rent-roll of his race
And wholly occupied his day—
And wild among them grew her words—
And wild festivities among
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
And wisely gallops to the hill.
And wished to say to him farewell.
And with emotional delight
And with gray hair ambrosial
And with his lot in life content,
And with remorseful anguish filled,
And would by candlelight arise.
And yet he in your cause would strive
And yet oblivion forbade.
And yet the city's flower was there,
And you, O maids immaculate,
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
And, by the way, I here assert
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
And, inspiration firing me,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Anew the flames of passion start
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Anicia soon appears, the door
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Another bard with art divine
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
Another his betrothed was given;
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Another tribune of the ball
Another visit hastes to pay.
Another with cock's head appeared,
Another! to none other I
Anticipating woe she pined,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
Appear attuned to softer chords;
Appear; along the road of Tver
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Applause, the people's donative.
Approach not to gaze at
Approach not to hearken
Approach, approach; I am thine own.”
Approaches Olga and the pair
Are admirable, my dear friend,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Are not with elegance impressed.
Are oft deceptive—like their feet.
Are turned upon her. All combine
Are ye replaced by other maids
Arising with the morning's light,
Around her neck, now violently
Around my stanzas incomplete
Around the carriage of the pair—
Around the garden homeward hies.
Around the meadow and the grove.
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
Aroused in him some tenderness.
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
Arrange without the least delay—
As Saadi anciently averred—
As Winter in their purity,
As a babe's slumber, or the light
As a poetic life serene,
As bees who leave their dainty store
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
As cyphers others to appraise,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
As deaf and silly doth remain,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
As every journal now entreats,
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
As formerly much agitation.
As formerly the shepherd sits
As giddy youth's hilarity—
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
As if against obstruction sore
As if he cruelly had joked!
As if impossible it were
As if it were some funeral feast.
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
As if with eider-down is filled.
As in a garden when I grew,
As in a thicket's humble shade,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
As in the timid forest deer,
As in their turn the seasons roll.
As it were, tore himself away.
As lordly mansions ought to be,
As many dinners I rehearse,
As many entertainments be!
As men who much had done that day.
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As on the rapid wings of thought
As once, to fill the rapid page
As one who bivouacs afield,
As partner of my mournful days,
As rosy lips without a smile,
As storms which in chill autumn rage
As the reflection of his age,
As the sins of my youthful days
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As to a worthy man and good!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
As we lure the young gallant,
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
As with innumerable fires.
As yet none had discovered aught;
As your light footprints on the green.
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Assemblies oligarchical
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Assistance ever will extend,
Assuredly should not have been
Asunder was and hate prepared?
At Làrina's abode produced
"At Làrina's.”—"Hem, that is queer!
At Russ she was by no means clever
At a great feast against desire,
At an old aunt's they had arrived
At each extreme one takes his stand,
At early morn returns the maid
At eighteen not to play the fool!
At eventide would hither come,
At fifty who relief obtained
At first for books was disinclined,
At first such contradictions wrought
At first, I clung to secrecy:
At first, but soon became inured
At forty suffered from the gout,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
At home arriving he addressed
At last became a ruined man.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
At last my father gave his blessing,
At last the author!” cries Mamma.
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
At morn I must assuredly
At morn an icy bath within
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
At neighbouring hospitalities.
At prisoner's base she never played.
At seven in summer rose from bed,
At table she was sitting by
At the front gates, but in brief space
At the same hour she oped her eyes
At thirty who was married well,
At this time almost understood.
At times my reason almost bends,
At times talk nonsense with design;
At times three words to him addressed
At times to silence would resort,
At times, if only once a week,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Athwart the snow four paces came—
Attend in male attire arrayed.
Attentive be unto my rhymes
Attentive listened to his speech,
Attentive listened to the lad.
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Attractive in its banefulness?
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light—
Authors replete with sacred fire
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Avenge himself in proper style.
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
Awakens secret merriment
Away her golden earrings tore;
Away! and cease to ring their praise
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
Awhile sound conversation seems
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Aye bids ye in some way or other—
Back to his regiment must roam.
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Bard of the "Feasts,” and mournful breast,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Basins and jugs—well! everything
Bear gone—she at the threshold placed;
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Because a member I became.
Because he could not gourmandise
Because he yawned at the bare view
Because her passion wanted art,
Because in singleness of thought
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Because she was so innocent,
Become a faithful wife and e'en
Become alarmed. So never mind!
Bedding is laid out and to all
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Before a fire which feebly glows
Before he eighteen years attained.
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Before him her wild game of chance.
Before him red roast beef is seen
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Before such fond simplicity
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Before the dregs they shall divine
Before whom once in solitude,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Before you agonized to die—
Begins to talk of this and that,
Behind her a grave general.
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Behind, of glasses an array,
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
Behold the dames who once were fine
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Behold! orthography despising,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Behold! the world's opinion!
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain—”
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Believe me, of my present shame
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
Beneath the silver of the moon
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Beside the stormy sea one day
Beside the thundering abyss
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Besides, a duellist well-known
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Better than Chateaubriand did
Between myself and my Eugene,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Beyond this may attempt to write.
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Blest be the labours of the light,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill—”
Born of a babbler in a loft
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
Both day and night he now must pass
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Both were expectant of the hate
Both were of passion satiate
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
Bouyànoff too, my cousin, wore
Bouyànoff whisked off Poustiakova.
Bouyànoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
"Bring dinner now without delay!”
Bringing his partner corpulent
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Bruin is marching at her back!
Bu, ere he mounts the marble flight,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
Buried in meditation deep,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
But Eugene long hath left the press
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But Eugene, hating litigation
But Eugene, incontestably,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
But I—what is all this to me?
But I abandoned their array,
But I am now another's bride—
But I await thee: scarce alive
But I came not to adulate:
But I must add to what I write
But I must now employ my Muse
But I perceive thou dost not heed—”
But I the products of my Muse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
But Lenski, I should be so glad
But Lenski, having no desire
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
But better loved the soft repose
But boldly I myself resign:
But borne in spirit far away
But cannot stand the northern cold.
But contrary to her advice
But even thus not now-a-days!
But finally grew bored by her.
But finally in wedlock bind.
But finally she heaves a sigh,
But from the Muses' loftiest height
But gray Phillippevna the door
But grown familiar side by side
But he desired not to beguile
But if my lot unfortunate
But if the truth I must relate,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
But lo! already the moon's light
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
But look you—ah! do not refuse.”
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
But Olga would not such peruse.
But as to fighting—'twill appear!
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
But by degrees the crowd begin
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
But cannot anyhow evade
But competition I abjure
"But death from him will be delight.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
But fashionable hatred's flame
But finally he oped his eyes
But first permission did request
But followed the strict rules of art,
But fools—their calumnies and sneers”—
But from the interview what flowed?
But grant with magnanimity
But he who by the Muse was nursed
But home his body to despatch
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
But it grew late; he must not stay;
But kindness from his eye had beamed
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
But man of sense and probity.
But memory like a serpent's tooth
But merely to exasperate;
But more the passions occupy
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
But no reply unto her made.
But not at present, though sincerely
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
But now—none heeds the monument
But now a question in this wise
But now all doubt was set aside,
But now in her effulgence pale
But now my mind is desolate,
But now our minds are mystified
But nowhere can she find repose,
But of this love, e'en casually,
But on the third of grove and mead
But once more pensive and distressed
But one thought only filled his mind,
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
But presently she tried to read;
But promise of our meeting gave,
But proudly in his song preserved
But say he was a genius who
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
But send your grandson before long.”
But shall depict the touching scene
But she, her sister never heeding,
But since to the backdoor they led
But sits in bed with air depressed,
But somehow there shone in his look
But soon she altered all her ways,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
But stares into the darkness deep.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
But still more stupid did appear
"But strange am I to happiness;
But strength of mind and self-restraint
But such is not my project now,
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
But Summer swiftly fades away
But Tania just as in a dream
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead—
But at a later, sterile age,
But could not. Then she questioned him:—
But finally she softly said:
But gazes on Onéguine's face
But in the drawing-room all appeared
But lights incendiary flames
But my Onéguine the whole eve
But nothing changed in them is seen,
But now—my very blood congeals,
But now—what brings you to my feet?—
But now our hero we must leave
But now ridiculous a bit.
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
But round the hostess scintillate
But sad is the reflection made,
But still remembrance to him clings,
But stop! I will present thee, if
But such is not for me. I brood
But suddenly all changed around!
But sweeter in a midnight dream
But sweeter still it is to arrange
But tell me what am I to do?
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
But that Princess Pauline of old,
But that the eyes of every one
But the dark sepulchre I may
But the date subsequently changed
But the indifferent princess,
But the young unpolluted heart
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
But this a heinous crime appeared
But this adventure's consequence
But this amusement delicate
But this is my advice, 'twere best
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
But thoughts meander far away—
But time flies and she doth forget
But to Onéguine! A propos!
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
But to the garden once again
But trembles, words he cannot find,
But trembling on the mirror dark
But tremor still her frame possessed,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?—
But turn we once more to our dame.
But turning morning into night,
But ultimately doth approach.
But upon all that Eugene knew
But was our friend Eugene content,
But were it not immoral I
But what a nuisance it will be,
But what astonished do I find
But what results? His eyes peruse
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
But when the winter season came
But when two minutes she had sat,
But where Melpomene doth rave
But wherefore not?—'Tis pleasant, nice,
"But which, my dear?—In days of yore
But who abandon it—as I
But who in that choice company
But why are your cheeks whitening?”
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But will not modify a tittle—
But with austerity!—for you
But with confused and bashful air,
But with her elder sister I
But word for word his letter read.
But would not look at Cicero.
But wretched who anticipates,
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
But you must both be quite tired out!
"But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
But, O ye tomes without compare,
But, after mutual compliments,
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
But, as he never opened them,
But, her own room in memory,
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
"But, mátushka, to Moscow you
But, that life longer may remain,
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
But, when Onéguine's turn came round,
By "belle Tattiana” to replace.
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
By Olga stood, dejected quite
By Olga's hand distributed
By Providence's dark decree!
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
By absence who hath chilled his love,
By an avowal just as plain.
By an obrok's indulgent rate:
By bee and butterfly which pass.
By children and by faithful wife
By daily life deteriorated,
By dull insensibility,
By every proper-minded wife,
By friendship how they were abused,
By indolence and languor fired
By love's inevitable flame.
By many a lamp illuminate,
By neighbouring families bewept,
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
By rank as settled by the State.
By such allusions scandalous,
By sympathy I have been driven.
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
By the fine silver of the north.
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
By time (who can anticipate?)
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
By a rich pie were occupied—
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
By computation) it is like
By flattery and lover's art—
By fond illusions once possest
By his embarrassed dignity—
By liberties or loose or light.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
By night prepared for sorcery,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By recklessness amuse or shame
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
By the sick lady's gaiety
By their own horses, not the post—
By visions who was ne'er deranged
By waters shining tranquilly,
By what idea or observation
By whom the youthful bard was slain?”—
Byron's capricious phantasy
Calling to mind your icy look
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Callous to all on earth become—
Calm and without embarrassment,
Calmly her eyes encounter his—
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?”
Can count the time without much fuss—
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Can she have been a moment gone
Can we not stealthily make out
Cannot they amicably smile
Canto the First of this romance.
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fêtes;
Careless of every social rule,
Careless of fame his spirit high
Caricatures he now designed
Carried a truth divine away;
Carried away by ecstasy,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Caught him and by the collar took
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
Certain misfortune near opined.
Certainly not Eugene alone
Chained to his bedside night and day
Change of position had essayed,
Charming is your sincerity,
Charming with grave simplicity.
Charms more enduring in the end.
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
China and bronze the tables weight,
Choosing a profitable trade,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,—
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
Come sing we in chorus
Come to my golden palace, dear!
"Come,” she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Command him not to say a word—
"Command me, darling, what you choose”—
Commence a new career in life
Companion of my childhood's days.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Confront thy fated torturer!
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Conquer by passion and address,
Conscious of death approximate,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Constant affection intertwined
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Contemplativeness, her delight,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
Contented and with victuals stored,
Conventionality's dull tool—
Corneille's majestic genius,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Could in romantic mantle drape
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?”
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Cunning already to display
Cursing his own stupidity,
Curtly announcing for the fray
Custom the despot soon prevails.
Customs by ages sanctified,
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Daily of love in solitude.
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Dark shadows thicken—a dread cry
Dark was the valley and the wood
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Debate commanded ample food—
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!”
Deep in the distant province rude,
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Deep into debt his father ran;
Deliberate approach of guests
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Delighted glances in return;
Delighted much his former ways
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
"Delighted.”—"When?”—"This very night.
Delusions of a mind untried,
Demands that I translate for you
Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Depart in peace and friendly live?
"Departed Lenski here to dine
Departed, ordered out his horse
Depicted on your haughty face!
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
Descended swift in turbid streams
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Describe in detail the affair,
Descried before me suddenly!
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Desire to rule ye may observe
Desirous to annihilate
Despair and anger seize on me,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Detecting him the passing horse
Detest him for a brother slain?
Develops and matures its powers,
Device of rural minds acute!)
Devoured them with an eager zest.
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Diminishes as years decline.
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Discovered much absurdity,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
Displayed a noble rectitude—
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Distinctly not its mechanism.
Distracted by her grief appears
Divinity without access
Do agitate his late repose.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
Do me a favour and appear.
"Do not—you might—suspicious be;
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Do we alone our losses mourn
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
Domestic life attracts me still,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Doth in us or our names appear
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go—
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Dreams with no continuity,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Dressed like a London dandy he
Dressing as quickly as he can,
"Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
E sempre bene, gentlemen!
E'en as the poet says he leant.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
E'en for an instant find delight,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
ETOT FILE CHISTIL MAXIM KATKOV
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
Economy political,
Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Either she saw not or ignored;
Either with him or thee in song,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,—
Employ your glasses constantly,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Encountered punishment complete,
Endless conjectures all propound
Endowing us from out her store
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Enhances love in estimation
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows—
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here.
Ennui can in the country dwell
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Enough! my pack is now unslung—
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay—
Enraptured was he if allowed
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
Epicurean philosophers,
Epistle second, note the third,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Ere conversation could begin,
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Espy him approaching,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Et cetera; but nothing showed
Eternally to imitate
Eugene at first began to dream,
Eugene designed with me to start
Eugene directs the trusty man
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet—
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Eugene of course related nought,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Eugene, more tolerant than this
Euphonious, though I know a spice
Even amusing fools we miss
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Even as the love of children dear.
Even beneath her parents' roof
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Eventually petrify
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Ever receive with kindly hearts
Ever to hear the same replies
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Examine her from head to foot.
Examined, mended, newly found
Except one by the window placed
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
Excruciate the heart and late
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Exist—that their immortal band
Existence calmly sped along,
Existence without wife or friends,
Existence would not make a curse,
Extended—haunt which Dryads love.
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Extinguished ashes do not blaze—
Faces which we meet everywhere
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Familiar to him long ago.
Fantastic images shall swarm
Far from his Italy—his own.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
Farther Tattiana's walks extend—
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Fashion is there immutable,
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
Felled a calumniator base!
Finally tost his arms in air
First reconciled and then content;
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
Fles past the porter to the stair,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Follow up love—a secret meeting
Fond declarations they invite
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
For I myself was thirteen quite;
For a protracted space of time.
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
For empty sound the rascal swore he
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
For first "madame” his wants observed,
For him were but of little worth,
For journalistic deglutition
For law I far niente take
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
For consecrate to me he fell
For evermore had disappeared.
For evermore is separate.
For him an honourable grave,
For long he had endured them all.
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
For Moscow fops and Circes each
For a fictitious misanthrope,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
For ever faithful will abide.”
For ever your Tattiana leave.
For every loyal Russian breast!
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
For long—for ever. To be sure
For my wild garden and bookcase,—
For o'er a word to fashion known,
For on their brows I trembling read
For otherwise—God only knows!
For our amusement ever made
For our Automedons are fire
For patience, reader, I must plead!
For promises her feet reveal
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
For rural solitude and dreams,
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
For summer to the country flown,
For tallow, wood and other things
For the first time the hammer clicks.
For the impatient chief instead.
For the young poet they display.
For there he left a mournful trace.
For treachery had done its worst;
For twice you came to them and yet
For two whole days it seemed a change
For us, may be for many a year.
For visions of my childish years
For was it not her duty to
For which no springtime shall appear?
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
For which the poet agonized
For who imposture can endure,
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
For your instruction here to tell
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Forgotten in the village lone,
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Found the ideal of my youth,
Found them in darkness side by side,
Four deadly paces do they span;
Fragments of northern poetry,
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Friends and companions,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Friends of the sons of every land,
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
From Romulus unto our day.
From gales a hill behind was seen;
From Gottingen inspired he came,
From apprehension of the cost,
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
From careless stanzas such as these,
From everything the heart held dear
From first to last page to the rim.
From habit or maliciously,
From hall to yard and garden flies,
From happy inspiration flow,
From hence engrossed in thought profound
From henceforth I confide to thee!
From her half-open vest of night.
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
From mere vacuity of mind
From public and from private ties,
From shades of the relentless past.
From storms protection having sought,
From such digressions wholly free.
From the dread pistol turn away.
From the moist cork the bottle freed
From whose analysis minute
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
Full many a lovely star hath night
Full of exasperating thought.
Funeral amateurs abound!
Furious he from the table rose;
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing—see!
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Gazing into his face, she said:
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand—
Gazing upon a note below.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Girls in anticipation skip!
Girls the kashourka much prefer.
Give me just half a glass of wine—
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
Gliding in negligent career,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Glittered in a perspective long,
Glory with which our history teems
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
God grant I meet not at a ball
God grant that all who herein glance,
God knows! The very trace is lost.
God save his soul eternally
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
"Good-bye, Onéguine, I must go.”—
Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
Grant that I err not on the road.”
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Gravely repeating to another
Great sacrifices for his sake!
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Gvozdine, Bouyànoff, Pétòushkoff
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Habit alleviates the grief
Habit was given us in distress
Habit would bring indifference.
Had a deluded victim been
Had bid her sigh for without hope—
Had come both friends and enemies—
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
Had finished life amid his sons,
"Had he been long here, and where from?
Had killed me had the like been told.”
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Had much to do at home that day,
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Had perished a creative mind,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Had rendered him an invalid;
Had run across her path at speed,
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Happy and glorious. But this brings
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Happy who thereto can unite
Happy who timely grew mature,
Hard by the window took her place.”—
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Hateful the hollow world became,
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
Have echoed to eternity.
Have entered never to return.
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Have my Onéguine—suddenly.
Have one by one all withered grown
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Having for money's sake alone
Having lost all in life we prize.
Having once fixed your interest,
Having performed his service truly,
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
Having this mournful document
He "Benedetta” used to hum,
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
He back as from a sudden blow?—
He bending whispered in her ear
He bends his course to Talon's, where
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
He brought from mystic Germany
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
He called upon me Christmas Eve—
He cannot give me happiness.”
He cared no longer there to stay,
He conversation would have led—
He could in disputation shine
He daily in his drives drew near
He deemed his coming would inspire
He deemed his friends but longed to make
He deemed of human life the goal
He dragged her by a forest road
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He drops his pistol silently.
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
He enters. High the cork arose
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
He enters: rapidly discussion
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He eyed her with a fond concern,
He feared the criminal might try
He felt the laudable desire
He finally lost all delight
He fixedly upon her stares—
He found him on the table laid,
He found them in an almanac,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He had excepted from the ban:
He has returned, say in what guise?
He hath acquired the world's esteem
"He hath neglected us of late.”—
He heard his soul's complaint within,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,”
He in imagination saw
He in the early years of life
He is a charming youth and wise.
He is not there: I am not known:
He kindled his poetic flame.
He knew not how to spend his life.
He knits his brows—'tis silent all.
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
He left you first, and I must own
He leisurely adorns for her.
He lies, upon his forehead death,
He long should have been on the road.
He loved the simpleton to mock,
He marmot-like did hibernate,
He might his motives have narrated,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
He now a full possession takes,
He obstinately will remain,
He offers her his murderous paw;
He oft upon his lips would curb,
He on his bosom gently placed
He on the conflagration frowned.
He ought to have conciliated
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
"He promised here this day to ride,”
He quits the fashionable throng
He racked his brains to find its clue
He read as vainly as before,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He reads at random, reads in vain.
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
He roars, and "Ah!” Tattiana cries.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
He salutary rules poured forth?
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
He sang of love—to love a slave.
He sang of separation grim,
He sat, and then the livelong day,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He somewhat blushing would omit:
He still made love in a queer way;
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
He there is master—that is plain;
He thought so, and existence charmed.
He thought to write, but labour long
He to the festival repairs,
He took no more the slightest heed;
He took the room wherein the old
He used to hate—and was no fool—
He usually was glad to see
He wakes—they with a letter come—
He wanders in his indolence;
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
He was a dear delightful fool—
He was an honest gentleman,
He was beloved: or say at least,
He was deceived. Just as before
He was in error; for Eugene
He was most gay. The happy date
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
He was no more! The youthful bard
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
He went not—sooner was prepared
He who economy abhorred,
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
He who life's frosts which early wrung
He whom we sing to shall be made
He will delight you, I am sure,
He with an innocence extreme
He with his little maiden played,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
He would not that a man ye slay
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
He yawns, averts his countenance,
He's a freemason, so we think.
He's a straightforward little chap.”
Heard he the truth? And thus she could—
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Hears not my importunity!
Heart would not throb albeit in jest—
Heaved an involuntary sigh
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Her Moscow cousin, often told
Her all in all did constitute;
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her foot was in my other hand.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Her agitation and distress
Her amorous experience
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Her brow she did not e'en contract
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
Her handkerchief she loses now;
Her head upon her breast declines
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her heart importunately turns.
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her manners were deliberate,
Her money counted, and designed
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Her path across the plain doth keep—
Her promptings unto law did make,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
Her sentimental verses all,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Her shoulder—Olga swiftly came—
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave—
Her sisterhood delights the young
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
Her utterances ever heard,
Her weary eyes are filled with tears—
Her with a smile old women greet,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
Here I remark all poets are
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
Here bottles stand in close array,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
Herein my portrait should detect,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Highways all Russia will unite
Him a disquietude did seize,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
Himself transformed into a hack;
His ardent soul with full delight.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
His character attracted me.
His comedies, a noisy rout,
His constant soul could ever tire,
His course unto the running brook.
His daily occupations, lo!
His daughter's book to ascertain
His ditties were as pure and bright
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
His friends and also enemies
His friendship I acquired just then;
His furs are powdered on the way
His harp beneath that sky had rung
His hate by slander, and who spends
His heart reciprocated still
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
His care unto his pistols' plight,
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
His cup unto his maiden dear.
His entrance with Onéguine. "Ah!
His fate shall presently decide.
His fist Onéguine fiercely shook
His footing on the treacherous rime
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
His breast was riddled through and through,
His butting horns in anger bent,
His chambers close wherein confined
His double sashes and his grate,
His energy and impotence.
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
His immorality of mind
His inner consciousness laid bare,
His intellect in close array.
His kneeling posture he retains—
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
His malady, whose cause I ween
His momentary loving glance
His mother from the door doth scold.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
His name: the tenderness of home
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
His own antagonists expert,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
His recent glory he invokes.
His relative and friend as well.
His ruffian bravery adored,
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
His son and mortgages his lands.
His son is married, just conceive!”
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
His soul by crash of music fired,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
His spirit was intent upon.
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
His tea with rum no more desired,
His transports were quite maidenly,
His travels like all other things
His uncle, busy man indeed,
His valet brings him letters three.
His vanity first let us pique
His visit she had not awaited,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
His watch, the sun in turn he views—
His weary head declined at rest,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His wife was also mad upon
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
Homeward returning, he at home
Honour and pride inflexible.
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
Hope with her fascinating power
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Horror! had she not better stay
How I have erred and felt the rod!
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
How artless was the note which spoke
How bitterly he would malign,
How bright and tender was his look,
"How came you then to wed a man?”—
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
How dark the night is getting though!
How deftly could he transport feign!
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How in the country pass this time?
How like a poet was my chum
How like the billow I desired
How mean, how pusillanimous!
How meekly then I heard you preach—
How much is in that word expressed!
"How now, Onéguine, yawning still?”—
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
How oft the kindly Muse away
How oft to the Crimean shore
How oft, when on a summer night
"How often in thine arms I lay;
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
How pleasantly the evening jogs
How sick to death his uncle lay
How soon he learnt deception's art,
How soon he learnt to titillate
How soon to habits she conformed
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
How the young imp on Tania doted!
How thoroughly her part she took!
How thy hands burn!”—"Dear nurse, I'm well.
How well he played the greenhorn's part
How with thy medal I would play,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”—
However cherries might abound,
However, Tania's letter reading,
However, the mazurka lacks
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
Hung like a print against the wall,
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
I also wandered there of old,
I am—in love—you know—don't tell!”
I am acquainted with fresh care,
"I am in love,” her whispers tell
I am in love, my hour hath come!
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
I am not strong enough to state;
I am not worthy them in aught;
I Apuleius gladly read
I ask, all ye who poets are,
I blame not your behaviour—
I by the button-hole seize fast
"I call to witness God on high—”
I can't conceive a little dear
I can't translate the adjective.
I cannot help it I declare,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
I cannot tell on what pretence—
I cannot tell the reason why,
I cannot understand. But lo!
"I celebrate a comrade young
I did not please you. Why pursue
I envied sore the billows tall,
I feel thou wast by God sent down
I feel, allotted is my span;
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
I formerly admired her much
I guard it as a holy thing,
I had found my predestinate,
I have dreamed many a vision fair
I have endured without respite.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
I have known beauties cold and raw
I have no leisure here to dwell,
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
I heard thy voice's resonance
I just hint, in parenthesis,
I know not if his heart felt pain
I know that Parny's tender pen
I know there's none more amiable.
I lift a warning voice because
I like the difference to express
I like this word exceedingly
I long by ballets have been bored,
I long enough deceived have erred.
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
I love its furious delight,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
I love you—to what end deceive?—
I love you with a brother's love,
I loved you—what did I obtain?
I married—now, I supplicate—
I mean my name not to repeat.”
I might to connoisseurs repeat
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed—
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared—
I must resign myself, in sooth;
I never should have seen your face
I on my chosen hero dote;
I once forgot for your sweet cause
I owe the censorship a little.
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
I promised!—Did I so?—Well, there!
I sail upon my lake at times
I say without poetic phrase,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
"I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
I slumber much, a little read,
(I speak not of our poems here),
I still a complication view,
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
I thank thee. In thy company,
I the same admonition make.
I then resolved my heart to tear;
I thought—retirement, liberty,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
I tried when I began this tale,
I uttered to my lady fair
I was for calm existence made,
I was half silly with affright.
I was incensed and he was sad.
"I weep. And if within your breast
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
I will not wed, and ever weeps
I will with thy divinity
"I with my friend intend to fight!”
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
I would desire my bride to be—
I would not part with finally;
I would your vigilance arouse,
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
I write to you! Is more required?
I write, and anguish flies away,
I yield for splendid vanities,
I yield the fruit of work severe.
I yield with a low reverence;
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.—
I'm beaten in another matter;
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?”—
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
I've had to make for having friends!
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
I've wasted in amusements vain,
I, after so much eloquence,
"Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
Idolatry of liberty,
If Olga smilingly approve,
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
If cleverly or not I prate.
If he had only known the wound
If his hot hand encountered hers,
If in the scenes of home I might
If not, the money I will lend.”
If seriously he hath disease;
If the choice in my power were,
"If the domestic hearth could bless—
If the fond hope I could have fanned
If the poor maiden could have guessed
If the raw product they possess
If they but heard domestic loads
If they were similar in aught.
If thou wert sitting by my side,
If wife and children to possess
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Imagination's sacred fires,
Imagine! Here alone am I!
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
Impatient waits the close of day,
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
Impelled to union with his own
Imperial portraits hang around
Impetuously clove its way
Imploring looks and mute complaint
Impressed him in the least degree,—
Impressionable for an hour,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
In Russ her love made manifest,
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
In a half-open dressing-gown
In a lax or informal way,
In age the memory gets worse,
In aimless ease and far from strife,
In amorous flights when so inspired,
In books he saw nought to condemn
In boston and the game of age,
In bud of promise incomplete,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
In charming fashion mutilate?
In clouds of steam above perceive.
In coach or post-cart duly placed
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
In company, or simply bowed,
In consultation stand aside—
In correspondence been allowed.
In country solitude you mope,
In country towns, where still it keeps
In course of time (the whole extent
In cruel solitude each day
In dreams and what the moon foretold
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
In duel having killed his friend
In fact, some people were assured
In fact, the subject analysed,
In former years thus did not I
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
In groups, official striplings glance
In haunts of fashion where each day
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
In her friends' albums, time had been,
In history he took no pleasure,
In hopes of everlasting fame
In horror for itself alone,
In idleness and tranquil joy
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In life domestic see a string
In little maidens of thirteen?
In love adventures she was versed,
In love's campaigns Onéguine heard
In love, although its tempests vex,
In love-lorn meditation sad.
In many things had changed his life—
In melancholy loveliness,
In mist profound all yet is hid.
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
In motley and amusing chase.
In much his conduct stigmatized;
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
In my young days of wild delight
In old age life is weariness!”
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
In one he doth accounts behold,
In one of thine enchanting lays
In one thing really did excel.
In order due the maidens pull;
In pages of a love narration
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
In rhyming I show laziness.
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
In scenes like these it may be though,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
In serious mood or dalliance
In silence shall I sit and yawn
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
In solid, unpretentious style,
In solitude or worldly din,
In some a willing martyrdom.
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
In spite of common sense we're wont
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
In springtime on the meadows green,
In such an album with delight
In that morass where you and I
In the French language perfectly,
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
In the beginning of this lay,
In the beginning, cold and mute,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
In the dawn of existence drear.
In the first place, say, am I right?
In the lone garden and the lane?
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
In the recesses what hath stirred
In the unfettered hours of leisure
In the unmoved, magnificent
In the world's mortal revelries,
In the world's vortex my success,
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In their sterility of prattle,
In this case quite mistaken was.
In this the love of the fair sex
In three weeks would arrive for them;
In thy imagination warm,
In time I'll give ye without fail
In times gone by thy bare command—”
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
In true interpretation hates:
In truth he had the happy trick
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In vain was youth by us received,
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
In what he merely acquiesced.
In whispers low the neighbours said:
In winter by its blank and dim
In winter on the fender bright,
In winter time would often come.
In winter, when Night longer holds
In worldly din or solitude
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
In your young days and also mine),
Incessantly his chains to break.”
Incited by his stormy Muse
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Indeed, by force of magnetism
Indifferent he became to all,
Indifferent was her future fate.
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Infallibly you there will find
Inflict annoyance and distress
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
Inhabited the country, clad
Inheritor of all his race.
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Insensible her hand remains
Inseparable from our lot;
Inseparable soon they be.
Inseparable they remained.
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Inspired but weariness intense;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
Inspired him with disgust and so
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Interrogation to denote.
Into accounts would sometimes look,
Into delicious bondage gave
Into the chamber where he slept
Into the cups already sped
Into the district then to boot
Into the lonely house she went,
Into the starry night extend.
Into the study of the boy
Into the tangled garden goes
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Introduce verse in conversation.
Invigorate imagination
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Is ever ready to proclaim
Is ever ready with relief,
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
Is full of frigid jealousy,
"Is he known to you?”—"Yes and No.”
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Is it for long?”—"Ma chère cousine!”
Is it not true? the objects fair,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Is it that I am now compelled
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Is it that human restlessness
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Is once again made manifest.
Is petted by the Emperor?—
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
"Is she in love?” quoth one. "With whom?
Is still condemned in love to be;
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
It carries of antiquity
It gradually possessed his mind;
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
It may be that I did proceed—
It may be that his martyred shade
It may be ye were born, or there
It may be, I yield nutriment!
It now to investigate is time,
It occupied him from a boy,
It wakens in my breast again.
It was a cheery, generous
It whiled his idle hours away
It will be by a mob beset
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Its driver seated on the rim
Its ebullition foaming white
Its insignificance I know
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
Its splendour and its blandishments,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
Ivan Petròvitch still a gaby,
Jackdaws on every spire—in scores.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Jealousy and vexation took
Jilted—glad of a holiday.
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Judge then what roses would be ours,
Just as he entered. How severe!
Just at a moment which I grieve
Just at that time his father died,
Just at the hour we designate
Just at this moment I cannot.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Just manages a feeble trot
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Know that thy face that day I see.
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Known unto children perfectly:
Kvass needful was to them as air;
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Laid down his life of sun and storm
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Landscapes thereon he would design,
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
Latest arrivals' salutations,
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Lay languishing both day and night—
Lead into good society,
Leaning against the dam expects,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
Learn to possess more self-control.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
Lenski as a good match received,—
Lenski at intervals would dare,
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Lenski his pencil-case took out
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Lessons to give he understood!
Lest jaded with satiety,
Lest the malicious reader or
Lest the world or her lord divine
Let me explain that in my song
Let me present ye to the man,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Let us congratulations pay
Let us go seek a little rest—
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Like him renouncing vanity,
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Like his, her dress was always nice,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Like Leonora did she ride
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Like a full moon magnificent.
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
(Like other things I could relate)
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown—
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Like you and me and all the rest?—
Likewise an epitaph with tears
List! the snow crunches—he draws nigh!
Listen to me without disdain.
Listless is she the livelong day
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Lo! in my garden was she found
Lo! my Onéguine free as air,
Lo! my Onéguine rural lord!
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Lo! with what pride celestial
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Long ago?”—"'Tis the second year.”
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Long in this fashionable cell
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Long since I held thee at the font—
Long time her young imagination
Long time in meditation deep
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Long, long the hour had past when home
Longer the East inert reclines
Longtime her mind is occupied.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
Longtime was her heart desolate
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”
Look through the window and kill flies.
Looks upon all with absent gaze
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Lost in the hamlet far away.
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Love to idealize inclined;
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Love's tender transports and distress,
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Made me so tipsy long ago!
Made revelations undesigned,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Maidens before her meekly move
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Make up your mind to go there.”—"Ah!
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Malignant fury they disclose,
Man—forty years long in this wise—
Many an ancient legend which
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Mark ye with what a modest air
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
May be that I by heaven's decrees
May be the empire of the sense,
May be, and this my terror wakes,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
May well in innocence impart.
May yet be studious of his nails;
Me now, inflict upon me pain?—
Me your perfections would not bless;
"Me?”—"Yes! It is Tattiana's fête
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Meantime Onéguine's apparition
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
Meantime in matutinal dress
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Measured with great exactitude.
(Mechanically, let us add),
Meet punishment for him provide.
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Men become friends from idleness.
Men love no more, as only the
Men opposite. The cross they sign
Men will forget me, but my urn
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
Merciful God, what will he deem?”
Method was dear unto his heart
Metreless verses recognizing
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
"Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.
Minutely I will now portray.
Miraculously fair arise,
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Moina recalls for this alone
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
"Monsieur l'Abbé” a starving Gaul,
Morality taught scarce at all;
More advantageously appear
More blooming than the Boreal flame
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
More crimson every moment they.
More satisfaction to her taste.
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
More timid than a doe long chased,
More troublesome than usual?”—"No!
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Most by this circumstance offended
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Most usually a Cossack horse
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
Mournful is thine approach to me,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Must be pronounced unfortunate—
Must bow in common courtesy;
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Must take a walk and rest a bit—
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
Mute glances interchanged aside
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
My beauty, thou art ready too.
"My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.
My country and an exile's lot;
My country's honour and repute
"My darling child, thou art in pain.—
"My darling, growing old am I!
My days of life approach their end,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
My famous portrait indicate
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
My friends, what means this odd digression?
My frivolous and jolly youth.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
My gratitude do not disdain,
My guardian angel to the grave.
My heart of old would captivate.
My heart with but one look revive;
My heart's allegiance can resign,
"My heart's delight, thou art not well.”—
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
My image hath not disappeared,
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
My light productions to retain,
My little book. With thee I knew
My lot is fixed—with thoughtlessness
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
My memory wandered wide and sought
My morning birdie, yesternight
My mother-in-law who lately died
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
My pen no longer finds delight,
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
My pretty self-deceiving maid—
My scholar without aptitude
"My second!” cried in turn Eugene,
My soul I cannot renovate—
My soul is filled with gratitude!
My spirit and my blood doth move,
My spirit with such pangs before.
My splendid house and gaieties—
My sportive Muse I used to take
My sum of happiness contained;
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
﻿"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
My unpretending page shall fill,
My venerated reader, oh!
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
My very latest composition!
My word of honour given have I.
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Mysteriously all objects near
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
Napoleon tarried till it please
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Nay, near—but destiny decreed—
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Near Khariton's in a side street
Near young Tattiana resident,
Nearer they come—Eugene appears!
Nearest and dearest knew not how
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Never for me to reappear—
Never upon my heroine
Next Saturday. The Làrina
Night separated from her spouse,
No answer all that day was borne.
No answer! He another sent.
No coquetry was there, I vouch—
No fond illusions live to soothe,
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
No greater pleasure can exist
No longer through her former home;
"No matter, look immediately.
"No misery I see in that”—
No more at dawn the shepherd will
No more remembered him; unto
No more the music thunders loud,
No more the village knows his face,
No more with pale Diana's rays,
No novelty—is it not true?—
No obstacle of which I know.
No one appeared to lend a hand.
No one my anguish comprehends,
No one the contrary will urge,
No other book had time to read.
No other than Onéguine mine.
No sense was ever manifest
No senseless fashionable lay
No signs of trouble her accused,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
No trace ye left in passing by
No, ever to behold your face,
No, never in the early blaze
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
None could a trace of that impute,
None could her beautiful declare,
None the conviction could withstand
None, be my witness Heaven above!
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Nor by her beauty she became
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Nor did her blushes fade away,
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Nor discontinued to distress
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
Nor even tears afford respite,
Nor frigid adulation paid.
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
Nor further comment that night made.
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Nor long his mind was agitated
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Nor on the letter yet hath she
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Nor shall the caterpillar come
Nor slander viciously could spread
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Nor years of separation all
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Not agony, but death expressed.
Not all will like myself proceed—
"Not at all.”—"That I can't conceive!
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Not even a poetic phrase,
Not high in general estimation;
"Not in the least, assured am I!”—
Not knowing its interpretation,
Not only sorrow—Ah! my dear,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Not so! My Moscow never went
Not that she had his works perused,
Not the least trace Onéguine sees
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Not to behave as he did once—
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Nought in the universe refused:
Nought of its charms original
November at the gate did stand.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Now I am ready to refuse.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Now all things round about repeat
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
Now it is ready to be sent—
Now of a family the head,
Now talkative, now reticent;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
Now with what eager interest
Now, as in a deserted house,
Now, like hereditary foes,
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
O Men, how very like ye are
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
O epic Muse, my powers increase
O feet, where'er your path extends
O triumphs of my guileless days,
O ye whom tender love hath pained
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
Obedient she had ever been
Obedient then to Nature's law,
Obedient to the magic strings,
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?—
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
Obsequious or indifferent!
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
Of "comme il faut.” Shishkòff, forgive!
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
Of Olga he in song averred;
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
Of creditors a hungry rout
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Of fiery youth's untutored days
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
Of friends unceremonious would
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Of love again, and yet again;
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Of many an economic scheme;
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
Of passion they so often raise.
Of roses to romancers dear;
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Of Russian domesticity;
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
Of a most mournful episode,
Of a strange night when the moon and—
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Of all the guests within his mind.
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
Of censure for the same incurred;
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
Of conversation, thought and aims—
Of error and the passions' strife.
Of every sort and every set!”—
Of fashionable dames the foe,
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
Of horn in circle call them round.
Of languor and of love did tell
Of late I have been quite absurd,—
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Of affectation innocent,
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Of consolation all bereft—
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
Of foreign whims the impersonation—
Of her provincial innocence
Of life or death predestinate.
Of London life is "vulgar” called
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Of friends the grateful intercourse—
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of migratory gipsy hordes—
Of modern Russians the disease.
Of my impassioned heroine.
Of my light paramour was proud.
Of old maids the divinity,
Of one thing till again we met.
Of passion reminiscences,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Of priceless value all things seem
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
Of such a dread hallucination.
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
Of tender years the modesty
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine—
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Of the horizon she is like!”—
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Of the night sentinels arise
Of the romances she preferred,
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Of touching lightly every theme.
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Of what he thought and what believed,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Of your perfections in my soul,
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Oft staring through the window pane
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Oh! I accept. And instantly
"Oh! I remember, where is he?”—
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!”
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Old people's simple conversations
Old women at the coachmen swear.
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Olga began to long likewise
Olga he sees before his eyes
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Olga the tea must supervise—
Olga with trepidation dire.
Olga's admirer came that day:
"Olinka is her junior, see.
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Onéguine—take him up again—
Onéguine—the beloved place
Onéguine Olga bore away.
Onéguine acted very well
Onéguine could not now submit,
Onéguine fired—Alas! alas!
Onéguine his excuses says;
Onéguine knew enough, the rogue
Onéguine lightning glances shot;
Onéguine meditative stood,
Onéguine ne'er as poet showed
Onéguine oped the cupboards wide.
Onéguine sat the table by
Onéguine slowly then began
Onéguine then approached and said:
Onéguine to the window went
Onéguine waits on us, 'tis like.”
Onéguine was—so many deemed
Onéguine was a citizen
Onéguine was the most impressed,
Onéguine wasted; on my word,
Onéguine went with trepidation
Onéguine whither gallops? Ye
Onéguine's Letter to Tattiana
Onéguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
Onéguine's letter!”—"Ah! the thing!
Onéguine's pencillings. His mind
Onéguine's speeches I abhorred
"Onéguine, I was younger then,
Onéguine, O my gentle readers,
"Onéguine, all this sumptuousness,
Onéguine, bored to death again,
Onéguine, by first impulse moved,
Onéguine, hast forgotten yet
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
On Sundays by yon window he,
On balls I madly used to dote,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
On horseback every day they ride—
On innocent delights I dote,
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
On this artistical retreat
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
On everything around her gaze,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
On guests their servants used to wait
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On lines invisible are fixt;
On melted wax in water poured;
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
On sunny days the glistening rime,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
On thee I used to meditate!
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
On unknown female forms he throws.
On us beyond the grave attends,
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
On whom a sister's heart was set
On winters of the south a skit,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
(One and the same thing it may be)
One image occupied his mind,
One instrument for his own use—
One moment's slumber suffer not.
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
Only her countenance assumed
Open the window—sit by me.”
Opened the portals of the tomb
Opened with care, and entering bore
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
Opens unto her visitor.
Oppressive now is happiness,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Or "Idol mio,” and in the grate
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Or a professor in tulle cap.
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Or better,—like a faithful wife.
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Or any trifle else ye like
Or bosom full of languid fire,—
Or but for fame he saw the light;
Or by a card our homage pay,
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
Or counting on his uncle's death
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Or e'en the "Demon” of my strain.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Or even overcome by wrath
Or even, silent and resigned,
Or faults of grammar on its page—
Or for the solitary tomb
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Or if he meant to flirt again,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Or innocently past me fly.
Or into bold hands anxiously
Or kiss the border of her dress.
Or letters of a maiden young.
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or parody of modern ways?
Or quietly partake our woe.
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Or reconciled them, it may be,
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Or that adoring Grandison
Or the delivery of a note.
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Or torturer malevolent?
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
Or will my melancholy glance
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Or, parable more flattering,
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Original imagination,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helène,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
Our liberty at least survives:
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
Our union would produce but grief.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Ourselves as unities to count;
Outlandish and provincial,
Outside descend the mists of night.
Pélagie Nikolavna has
Pétòushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Pétòushkoff, the provincial swell;
Page after page continued reading,
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Pallid and melancholy face,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Pardon I ask for such a sin—
Paris and Menelaus right.
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Passed into dull eternity,
Passes the torrent But alack!
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Past palaces and nunneries,
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Pedantic although scholar like,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Perchance one more affectionate.
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
Perchance they laurels also cull—
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!”—
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Pervaded with much common sense.
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Philanthropist or patriot,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Placed at the customary range;
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Poetic transport. They impart
Poetical enthusiast,
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
"Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Portray the solitary den
Portrayed contemporary man
Possess my love and sympathy.
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Possession hath no power to please,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Pray is it not a tough affair
Present me.”—"You are joking.”—"No.”—
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Presents her quarto amiably,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Priams of country populations
"Princesse, mon ange!”—"Pachette!”—
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Professions eagerly for deeds,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Providence otherwise may deem—
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
Quick to the country let us wend
Quite a sensation; the position
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Raged round him and of balked desire!
Raises within my breast as oft
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
Rebuffed—as quickly reassured,
Received him freely at her house,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Reform me both in deed and word,
Regained authority awhile,
Rekindled in my withered heart
Relate some ancient history.”
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Remained with him the youthful maid.
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Removed her to his country seat,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
Repentance wields not now her spell
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Replaced them in their box, undressed
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Repose her silken curtains fled,
Repose in peace, thou child of song.”
Rescue me from oblivion.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Resounding through all ages might
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Returning, from his ship amid
Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Rings from a dish of water full
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Romance of love I pray refer,
Romances pleased her from the first,
Romances three, in which ye scan
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Round which revolves the universe.
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Russia's Terpsichore review
Said something in an undertone
Sailed silently in unison—
Sails her allotted course on high,
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Scornfully challenged you afield—
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Secure in rural quietude—
Sed alia tempora. And bravery
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Seductive, animated, bright,
(See the first canto if ye will),
See, I can hardly crawl about—
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Seek the forgotten countenance
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Selfish nonentities around?
Serious endeavours to assure
Servant of God and brigadier,
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Shall I behold thee once again?”—
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
Shall my declining years beguile;
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
"Shall we commence?”—"Let it be so,”
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
She brought with her the gift of song.
She buries deep within her breast
She calm and unconcerned appears.
She cannot—Eugene oped the door
She cannot—then impatiently
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
She comprehends. The simple maid
She consolation thence obtained—
She could not sleep in her new bed.
She deemed its outline might afford.
She did not think "procrastination
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
She enters a deserted yard—
She fears and like an arrow rushes
She fears she cannot.—Cannot? Why?—
She found herself alone at last,
She from the winter corn espies
She gazed—a cue, forgotten long,
She gazed around her—it was day.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
She got a book of nursery tales,
She heard of servant-maids the note,
She hears of conversation nought
She hears the bear behind her press,
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown—
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She is an angel! We sometime
She led me through nocturnal mist
She leisurely away doth ride,
She loved upon the balcony
She mourned and to the moon would raise
She murmurs in an undertone
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
She nerves herself from her alarm
She never more his face may view,
She never of deception dreamed
She on the apparition gazed,
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
She peeped through a chink of the door.
She promised Eugene, or she would
She rose—departed. But Eugene
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
She sank.—"He's here! Eugene is here!
She seeks the garden in her need—
She seemed of him oblivious,
She sits alone—'tis ever she!
She soon forgot, began to call
She starts, nor doth a word express,
She strains her throat to force a cry—
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
She the acquaintances she loves,
She the delicious novel reads,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
She visited the humble tents
She waited for—I don't know whom!
She waits, on fire her trembling frame—
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
She was as heedless and as gay—
She was thus fond of Richardson
"She who with melancholy face
She will not see, she will not hear.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
She would pronounce à la Française;
She, than the morning moon more pale,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
Shines in the female firmament
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
Should be respected throughout life
Should dearly like a dance again.
Should go, the market for a maid,
Should make me much more circumspect,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
Shouts of applause! Onéguine passes
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
Shy, silent did the maid appear
Sickness more courage doth command
Sighs on another than her lord
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Since Eugene in that solitude
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Since in these arms I thee did bear—
Since leisure was together spent,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Singing God knows what maid admired,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Singing inside her hut the maid
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Sits down and gazes on all sides—
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
(So 'twas with us in former years,
So Tania to her heart's content
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
So ardently did I desire
So be it! But internal strife
So be it! Just the laws which bid
So frequently his mind would stray
So from the mountain lazily
So full of piety, correct,
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
So inaccessible to men,
So irremissible appear?
So let us to the ball-room haste,
So many neighbours here exist—
So meantime let him joyous live
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit—
So prudent, and so circumspect
So she her silken sash unlaced,
So she in French herself expressed.
So there will be a dance to-night.
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
So uncongenial to my mind,
So, when he came next day to call,
Society endures not such!
Society he duped enow.”
Society renounced once more.
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Some Russian authors he perused—
Some a mazurka occupies,
Some are afar and some are dead.
Some army poet therein may
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
Some future ignoramus shall
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
Some marriageable maids behold,
Some nice instructive novel read,
Some one or other editor
Some other long-departed Spring,
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Sometime collected, shall relate
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail—
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Spare yourself unavailing pain
Spared him not their asperities.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Spoiled children most degenerate
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Still certain authors, I may add,
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Still everywhere, without, within,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Still of his club he member was—
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
Straight for the entrance then he made
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Straight from their province had he come?”—
Strange unto her each childish game,
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Striking the intellect with awe
Struck Lenski dead—across the scene
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Submissive as if in a swoon,
Subscribed, toujours à vous, Annette;
Successfully to please her tried,
Such am I. This did ye expect,
Such is the country custom good;
Such open-hearted innocence.
Such was Onéguine's sainted life,
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Suddenly to the left hand side,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
Surely ye all have overhauled
(Surely you know him as I speak);
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Swift following in her wake, the sun,”
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Take to their wings and fly away.
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Tania doth by the casement linger
Tania the meaning would obtain
Tania well nigh expired when he
"Tania, my eldest child, you know”—
Tania, observed by nobody,
Tattiana—thus the sex is born.—
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick—
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
Tattiana certainly infers
Tattiana courage doth regain
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
Tattiana every day conferred
Tattiana faltered, and became
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Tattiana from the hill descends
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
Tattiana gently led them there.
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Tattiana in the yard appears
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tattiana in traditions old
Tattiana learns the intelligence—
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Tattiana more than ever burned
Tattiana motionless abides.
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Tattiana to the index flies
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Tattiana was her appellation.
Tattiana with impatience waited
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Tattiana would have gladly heard
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Tattiana's letter I possess,
Tattiana's Letter to Onéguine
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”—
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
Tender and elevated, free?
Terpsichore alone among
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
Terror assails her. Hastily
Terror of guardians of the night;
Than cold Onéguine's oddities,
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Than one's own fascinating self.
That Heaven her character had blent
That I am rich, a prince's wife?—
That I forget not whom I sing.
That I to you reveal my mind?
That Nina's marble symmetry,
That a friend's arm in every case
That afterwards with evil smile
That all may hear his voice's tone.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
That certain volumes she might read.
That chosen heroes consecrate,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That every morn at Verrey's cost
That first the Muse appeared to me.
That for that matter in my verse
That girl—but he must dreaming be—
That girl whom once on a time he
That glimmered through the radiant night
That grandmothers and grandsires may
That guests approach: and when above
That he was "ready any day.”
That heart with inspiration sweet
That hero, though his merit shone,
That is, he could elucidate
That like a friendly voice its tone
That mediocrity alone
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
That my dishonour would ensure
That our desires which noblest seemed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
That the two friends with morning's light
That until Christmas comes again
That vanished are my youthful days
That vicious set whom I don't blame—
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That we her constantly betrayed
That year the autumn season late
That youthful heart—"But, now at least,
That, for the century designed,
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
The "in memoriam” pages sought,
The German baker looks around
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
The amatory science warm,
The body they consigned to rest,
The boy was wild but full of grace.
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
The child of sloth and liberty.
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
The contact of the foot I raised
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
The crowd and merriment and light,
The curtain now they slowly raise.
The days of love and of romance!
The disenchanted glass direct
The drama of my youth was played.
The drum already doth arouse.
The dusty chronicles of earth
The early days of life we sought.
The father scarcely understands
The feeble moment would espy
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The fires of passion and its smart—
The firmament in mellow light,
The friend of liberty and laws
The giddy world at last shall see.
The goddess would a masquerade
The happiest days of life employ?
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
The hero is of my narration!
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
The lamps illuminating shine;
The malady of hopeless love
The manners of the highest class
The medium is required of gold.
The moderns of the ancients rave—
The most industrious man alive
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
The accents wild of other's woes,
The ancient barshtchina replaced
The bath on Saturdays attended,
The bridegroom sage without delay
The cold reply with gloomy mien
The conversation tedious
The converse of our hermits twain,
The cynosure of every eye.
The fatal secrets of the grave,
The fervid poet would recite,
The fruits of learning and combined
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The gifted songster never swerved,
The girl in marriage they unite.
The gossip of their ladies fair.
The gulf between them was so vast,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
The hero's name too in advance,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
The kennel or a kindred line,
The laws of generations past,
The lonely mansion-house to screen
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
The matter did not agitate,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
The moon, the stars, and shining night—
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
The nights of golden Italy
The path of hope and tender fear—
The path which leads to glory's goal.
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The pervert world with icy chill
The poet's fervid conversation
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
The prejudices all men have,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
The riot of the world and glare
The Russian N with nasal sound
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
The bays of age and helplessness.
The deuce with my inside has played.”
The drive becomes monotonous—
The epitaph on marble shows:
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
The God of Love is after you!
The Làrinas unwisely went,
The Làrinas were since sunrise
The Làrinas would celebrate,
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”—
The Lord deliver her and save!
The Maidens' Song
The Russian language I deem vile
The aged nurse in ample gown,
The aged woman in her woe:
The all-entrancing joys of love—
The artful prisoner should seek
The break of day she doth not see,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The china teapot too ye might
The days which to your youth belong?
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
The evanescent fashions fly
The excited hero in a trice
The fair of the next generation,
The fatal hour had come at last—
The fated nutriment desired;
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
The frolics of maidens.
The hostess doth interrogate:
The idols of their adoration
The image of her seal impressed.
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
The less we love a lady fair
The letter is the thing, you see,—
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
The Lovelaces are out of date,
The Russian winter did adore
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
The captain of a company.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
The clue unto some mystery
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
The company deep silence guard.
The country hath its liberties
The credulous indeed are blest,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The curse of commonplace delight.
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
The door flew open—Olga came,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The dream left terror in its train.
The fair, nor parted with regret,
"The family are all quite well—
The family of Kharlikoff,
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The first appearance of the snows
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
The forests in mysterious gloom
The friends are called and quickly placed.
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
The goblet still is bubbling bright—
The golden ember now enshrines,
The guests make room; aside each takes
The hero we immortalize.
The imagination to enliven
The insensate fire of love still glowed
The language of her girlish pleading
The last poor obol I was worth—
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
The maids beside Tattiana keep—
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
The military band will play.
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
The monsters of the British Muse
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The mystic lines to tear away
The mystic monogram, O. E.
The native Russian tongue impeach?
The natural fickleness of passion,
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
The olden time shall be my theme.
The pains of night have wholly fled,
The Paris of those country parts
The altar flame was quenched in night.
The avalanche of snow first bends,
The ball in all its splendour shone.
The bard his answer waits at home,
The blessings of humanity.
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
The comrade of your youth should strike,
The epistle from the bard presents.
The fatal bullet penetrate,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
The feet of my dear lady friends.
The fire extinguished in his breast,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
The freshness of her heart impair,
The glass unwittingly inspect
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The lily's stem to eat away,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
The man and liked his company,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
The matter by his conscience tried,
The memory of the bard, a dream,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
The miserable bard to meet,
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
The Muse capricious let us coax,
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
The bee forth from his cell of wax
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The breath of Spring again renewed,
The calm existence which I prize
The chaise long ordered please employ,
The channel of the river stilled
The coach before a house stood still.
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
The connoisseur his glances throws
The converse of the world polite,
The counsel good and full of reason,
The crash of music, candles' glare
The curs away to kennel chase,
The damsel under escort place.
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
"The date, his fleeting years how long—
The early tinkling of the bells
The eyes of a grave general.
The family of children hie.
The fisher's fire afar illumes
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
The house and garden I would see.”
The household property contain:
The household troop of little boys,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The languid mind could smile at nought,
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?”—
The limits of enlightenment
The little solitary nook
The maiden at her casement sits
The master always used to sit.
The memory of the bard was driven
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
The motley moving mass and bright,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The butt of scandal having been,
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The general who accompanies.
The lady in the crimson cap
The lady's glance upon him fell—
The maid whose note he still possessed
The men salute with lower bows
The nightingale there all night long,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
The opportunity is flown.
The pall of night was growing thin,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
The peasants there are rich as kings,
The perfidies I recollect
The pile of books, with carpet spread
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
The poet fell; already men
The poet from Tamboff secured,
The poet's hour hath sounded—See!
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
The poet, modest though so grand,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
"The post hath kept him, it is like.”
The powder in the pan is laid,
The prince's eye Onéguine seeks:
The Princess N. will be at home
The artifice of villany—
The conversation was revived
The crystals of her vestibule
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
The fever of the blood to slake—
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
The gilding of life's vanities,
The hour when—Fate so willed—we met
The hours once more Onéguine counts,
The husband comes and interferes
The indignation of her heart!
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
The lively trash of stories long
The old man who has had his freaks,
The princess from the sofa cried
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
The reaping girls approach and ply
The remnant destiny concedes,
The rigour of cold pride and all
The river through the linden wood.
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
The room my former master used.
The ruts of his own fatherland.
The sad moon only could remark.
The same unmoved oblivion
The same warm vision constantly;
The secrets of maidens.
The secrets of the marriage state
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
The serpent to unlawful trees
The servants used to congregate
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
The sharp incisions of his nail,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
The shining orbs of night appear;
The shining pistols are uncased,
The shining river clothed in ice;
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The shutters open; to the skies
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The simple epitaph—a tear
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
The sneers of critics superfine;
The snow descends and buries all,
The snow upon the streets doth melt—
The snows from off the hills around
The solstice of our earthly years,
The sorrows of a single state.
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
The starry beacons fade away,
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The steward sent a note to tell
The stomach doth admonish us.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
The story of his young love's dream,
The story of thy life and fate.
The strange apartment her oppressed:
The strife grew furious and Eugene
The style in which my hero dressed;
The style of wise antiquity.
The sudden rattling of a car.
The sum of my existence gone
The sun had mounted high his steep,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
The table with its lamp unlit,
The tale of these romantic men;
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
The time between the wolf and dogs—
The time for mystic strolls which late
The time when Melancholy's claw
The tiny sun shone less on high
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
The torment born of crime unseen,
The torrent of opinion,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
The trees in silvery array,
The triumph of a conquest new.
The troop of apparitions fled,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
The twilight pale which softens all,
The two friends' compliments she hears
The two old ladies then embraced
The unaffected traits she now
The unbidden guests he roughly chides—
The uncontaminated kiss
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
The venerable dame opined
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The very morning of our days.
The vestibule finds empty quite—
The vile seducer shall not dare
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
The votary of vain delight
The weary way still incomplete,
The wedding-day had been arranged,
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The windows whitened, shutters close—
The wit of others to acquire.
The witching light of sympathy;
The wolf upon the highways bold
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
The wood she enters—bear behind,—
The woods, still naked to the view,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
The workpeople she superintended,
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The world enough. Congratulate
The world is ever altering!
The young Simeonova too there
The young proprietor we find;
"The younger, you're in love with her!”
The youthful lover once again
The youthful poet's fond confession.
Thee but a little space bewept,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
Their Jealousy and separation
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Their claims and explanations shout.
Their coming which no man expects,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Their glory with their heels of red
Their harmless conversation blends
Their heroes used to represent
Their idols they were wont to invest
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Their memory lingers still and seems
Their natural attractions lend
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Their own productions, some insist
Their privileged allurements fire
Their slander e'en was weariness;
Their voices nought to her impart
"Then amongst strangers I was left—
Then be it so! My destiny
Then became busy with the house,
"Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
Then dressed himself...
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Then glittering in the sun descends.
Then handed her the song with grace.
Then he'd malign them secretly
Then in the silent cabinet
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Then my companions young with pleasure
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
"Then send your grandson quietly
Then suddenly discharge a joke
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Then they came easily enow,
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Then to reward such confidence
Then to some gallant in your turn
Then touching Olga they depart
Then weeping she sank back distressed
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Then ye were barely generous,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
Then, her distraction to allay,
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
Then, the far capital forgot,
Then, then—well, in some solitude
There Didelot became glorious,
There an imperious skeleton;
There came a sudden flash of light,
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
There friends of pure delight had been
There is a spot the village near
There is no fishmarket retort
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
There is no stupid calumny
There is no wreath upon the bough:
There jars of cider block the way,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
There our Katènine did revive
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There was no angling for success.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
There, in that knot of company,
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
There, when the rains of spring we mark
Thereon the passing traveller read:
These are your relatives, believe:
These evenings as in days of old
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
These take their seats; the coach of state
These to the coach of state are bound,
They are all natural and low,
They blossom, ripen and they fall
They crack a feeble joke and smile—
They deem her somewhat finical,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
They growl a bit—they scandalise—
They hand in hand to table go.
They have invited you this week.”
They in a peaceful life preserved
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They long ago had held debate.
They long at home have her expected—
They made him feel inclined to doze;
They may forget that we exist.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
They sat, but conversation's flow
They sent their compliments—but oh!
They shout and no one lists at all.
They shovel silver with a spade,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
They were the wonderful traditions
They will receive us with delight.”
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
They would not solemnly debate
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
Thine honour is my countersign!
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
This anchorite amid his waste
(This by command; for it was found,
This evanescent boyish bliss.
This gentle daring who could guess?
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
This great discovery relief
This he believed: a kindred spirit
This is my master's sitting-room.
(This joking I used to protest),
This life in masquerade concealed,
This lot in life with stern decree?
This monument of thought profound
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This northern summer of our own,
This separated us as well—
This was his social character.
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
This world. I do not praise desire,
This, this were true felicity!
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Thither in future to proceed
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Thou also, my ideal true,
Thou also, reader generous,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
Though I confess I hardly dare
Though I'll return to him right early,
Though around honoured Priam's throne
Though beauty he no more adored,
Though by an error and unsought—
(Though certainly mankind he knew
Though correspondence as a rule
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Though late, have a beginning made.
Though now my love might be intense,
Though of romance therein I fail
Though scarcely following what was said,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Though superannuated rather;
Though the foul vision promise made
Though to the Academy I come
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Though without palaces and streets,
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Thrice happy who their agonies
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
Through dense aristocratic rows
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus a guest with composure will
Thus age approached, the common doom,
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Thus did our friend Onéguine preach:
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Thus in a style obscure and stale,
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Thus oft—this I myself confess—
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
Thus to assassinate the eve?”—
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
Thus we began our little tale—
Thus widely meditation erred,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Thy meditative incantation—
Till January fell no snow—
Till absently Vladimir took
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Till morn—life uniform but gay,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Till proper rings could be procured.
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Time was, a valiant general might
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Time was, in style magniloquent
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Time was, the poet's tender quill
Time was, two maidens from their home
Time will the ravages efface—
Time without me will lessons give,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Tiresome unto her hath become
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
"'Tis habit, Lenski.”—"Is your ill
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
'Tis dreadful—ye agree, I hope—
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
'Tis fearful to anticipate
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
'Tis silent—on her shines the moon—
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
'Tis there that arrant fops display
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
'Tis time she to the altar went!
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
'Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”
Titles and ages intermixed.
"To—?”—"Làrina.”—"Tattiana?”—"So.
To Russ indigenous are not;
To a surrender gave consent,
To agitate me in my dreams.
To array himself in evening dress.
To be a charming mystery:
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
To dream upon the sunny strand
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
To God eternal hymns of praise.
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Olga frequently he would
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
To anticipate the break of day,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
To crush me with a just disdain.
To dire contentment shall give birth
To dominate her worthy lord,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
To ease the anguish of my breast.
To Eve the universal mother,
To fawn upon and love express;
To foreign lands he would allude,
To freeze his finger hath begun,
To guess how you the eve pull through.”—
To help her to the other shore
To his Penates now returned,
To idle musing was a prey;
To kiss the feet which I admired!
To labour in his sledge forgot,
To lay two covers secretly.
To light had brought them from their dust,
To listen to the rippling rill.
To listen to the words you speak,
To loiter there in idleness
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
To male acquaintances he bows,
To me he would his Olga give,
To mutter her concealed desire
To my old nurse alone peruse,
To peer into the future tries.
To purest love he tuned his note
To raise a clamour and a din:
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
To russify the foreign phrase
To secrets of virgins,
To see you by our fireside stand,
To sigh and meditate alone:
To sketch myself that I have tried
To slay himself with blade or ball,
To standards in which we believe?
To such—delightful to repel.
To swagger as the art of love,
To take a hand at whist oft come:
To take this letter to O— Well!
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
To accompany him and to escort
To all she answers cruelly—
To arid selfishness resigned,
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To ask her name the trouble took.
To banish far unworthy themes
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To captivate her how devoted!
To clank the spur, delight the fair—
To classicism I've homage paid,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
To consanguineous dinners they
To end with him her path below.
To find in gossip such delight,
To flight before her radiant look,
To friendship making no pretence,
To happiness contributing.
To her an elegy composed.
To jest as he had done last eve,
To look on life as on a show,
To Love all ages lowly bend,
To an assembly—she appeared
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
To be in conversation clear
To bear love's parching agonies—
To burn, yet reason keep awake
To follow you in every place,
To lawless love I should prefer—
To make wise men the idiot play
To many a noisy feast and fight,
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
To mention the foregoing eve,
To move in fashionable life,
To our Tattiana conquering,
To part in amity with thee!
To pass the night at home hath gone.
To pass with reasonable men
To raise his pistol to his eye,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
To see aught—never mind meanwhile)
To see his Olga ere the fray—
To seek him out with bended head.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
To stay the maid against her will.
To strike imagination serve.
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
To the assembly her they bear.
To the fair object of his dream,
To the impressions of our youth,
To the pianoforte he moves
To the sarcastic observation,
To the theatre he repairs
To the young girl he said adieu,
To the youth Eugene hurried now—
To this arrangement can be seen,
To thy decree my will I bend.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
To treat the matter as a jest,
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
To understand by slow degrees
To vary for a few brief days.
To visit Moscow in the season.
To visit, lovely maid, return,
To wander through the meadows still,
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
To what malicious merriment,
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
To whom are our misfortunes grief
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
To whom we used to consecrate
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
To whom your hearts were consecrate,—
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
To write his forefathers to warn
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To write of any other elf
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
To-day it is my turn to teach.
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
To-morrow before break of day,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Together moments one or two
Together they returned, nor word
Together we have wandered o'er
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
Tome of "Malvina,” and but three
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
Took aim—but as immediately
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
Transfixed Onéguine mine doth stay.
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
Transported to our Russian clime.
Trembles at artificial shame.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,—
Trembling he seeks the young princess—
Triquet arose, and for the bard
Triumphant by anticipation,
Triumphant with the answer come.
Triumphs—their own or those of friends—
Troy's sages should in concert own
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Turned to her and discordantly
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
'Twas plain—an oaken floor ye scan,
"'Twas possible then, happiness—
'Twas she who first within his breast
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
'Twas these he read and these alone
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
Two dressed in uniform appear—
Two hearts perchance were desolate
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Two verses he could recollect
'Twould serve ye in an epigram—
Undeviating and insane
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Undressed herself and went to bed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Unfavourable unto her.
Unhappily too salt by far;
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Unknown to all, without a tie,
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Until her heart less high should bound—
Until her powers of running fail.
Until the sleepless Bréguet chime
Unto a carping world must show—
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Unto Anicia for the keys
Unto her husband, went away—
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell—
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Unto the gates the servants fly
Unto the hero of this lay
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Unto the windmill he must ride
Unto their solitude one day,
Up to the attic, and all need
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?—
Upon her brow sits wrath alone—
Upon her cheek by adulation
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Upon his couch insensibly;
Upon its damp opacity,
Upon my lake I love to float,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
Upon the highway of the sea
Upon the meadows showering,
Upon the opening page ye find:
Upon the stage his weary glance.
Upon the table in a trice
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Upon the windows tracery,
Upon those margins she perceived
Upon those pages she descries
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Us from the world wherein we live.
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Variety of speech and vests,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Vice in romance is glorified
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Villages in the distance show
Virgins miraculous I see,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
"Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Vladimir Lenski visited
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Vladimir something curtly said
Vladimir's property, a man
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
Vociferously paid her court,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Waiting his coming—his alone!
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
Wallow, my friends, in company!
"Warm yourself here a little space!”
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
Was a delightful little spot,
Was born beside the Neva, where
Was certainly no Grandison.
Was certainly not erudite
Was drawn, ideal of my lay—
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Was he in health and void of care?—
Was it not so?—for thee I gave,
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
Was not surprised thereby at all.
Was nothing but the British spleen
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Was that which we are wont to call
Was the first question Olga made,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook—
Was with himself dissatisfied.
Was withered ere the morning light—
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Was younger than myself, my light,
We Russians, friends from distant parts
We all of us of education
We are the first who such a name
We called to mind our youthful days—
We glide along a floor of wax.
We hear with interest intense
We must admit but little taste
"We never loved in days of old,
We visit about Christmas Day,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
Well known unto Onéguine mine.
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
"Well!”—"I the elder should prefer,
Well! Làrina appears to us
Well! just as she was yesterday.
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Were I like you a bard by trade—
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Were to analysis subjected.
Were you in love when you were young?”—
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
What I by relatives conceive?
What a storm of emotions keen
What acrimonious scorn I trace
What agitation languidly
"What ails thee, dear?”—"I feel depressed.
"What ails thee?”—"Nothing.”—He is fled.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
What boots it with the age to strive?
"What can be done? She is no child!”
"What can be drearier than the house,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
What doth she see? Around the board
What everybody long has known;
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
What is his latest character?
What is thy cleverness to me?
"What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
What languor would his silence show,
What more's required? The world replies,
What never was remarked or heard
What once I knew is clean forgot—
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What say you? to the family—
What they in conversation said?—
What visions then her fancy thronged—
What will the coming dawn reveal?
"What! Grandison?”—"Yes, certainly!”
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
What, invitations? The same day
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
When I yon semicircle bright
When Passion's fire no longer glows
When all around the entrance pressed,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
When but a boy he Olga loved
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
When deaf and silent he doth lie
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
When first upon my cheek I feel
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
When he in ardent verse portrays
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
When in as instant she is lost,—
When in her walks abroad she met
When in simplicity ye wrote
When in that company she saw
When in the grand saloon was heard
When in the study's calm retreat,
When motionless your gaze beneath
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
When on the pallid eastern sky
When people with long countenance
When poets lachrymose recite
When separation's hour drew nigh,
When shall I wing my passage free
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
When the hour came to bid good-bye—
When the mazurka used to peal,
When the obedient doll in sport
When the same life before him lies
When the sonorous Bréguet tells
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
When will my hour of freedom come!
When will the devil take his own!”
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
When, sitting by his fire alone
When, where, and in what desert land,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Whene'er he had an aching head;
Where—”—"What! another eclogue spin?
Where God alone knows whom she met.
Where I can no more recollect?—
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
Where all upon the surface lies,—
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Where each young critic ready stands,
Where every day before his eyes
Where fashionable circles meet
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Where in the country Eugene yet,
Where is Onéguine? Half asleep,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Where long time he in solitude
Where many another hand had signed
Where melancholy rocks arise
Where my days in the wilderness
Where plentifully feelings flow
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
Where the first time I saw your face,—
Where the first time she met with him.
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Wherefore am I your quarry held?—
Wherefore regarding him express
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Wherein I castigation get;
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Wherein a space Onéguine spent.
Wherein love innocently pines.
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Wherein the miserable wife
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Whereto in language courteous
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Which in the elevated sphere
Which in the winter were a joy:
Which in your spirit dominates,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Which might for many ages last.
Which never have existed, e'en
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
Which of approaching labour tells
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Which shines with iridescent hues.
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
Which we experienced long ago.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
Whilst he "belle Nina” had the face
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Whither at headlong speed doth go
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”—
Whither departed is the host?
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither that evening he will go.
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Who by a haughty word or glance
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Who early died a gallant death,”
Who every gesture, every phrase
Who floats contentedly through life,
Who following Petrarch move along
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Who had for four long years survived
Who in the agony of grief
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Who in thy love finds more delight
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
Who labours hard to humour us?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Who now could fail to recognize
Who reads his visionary theme
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Who the romance do not complete,
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
Who to surrender did not blench
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
"Who will be there?”—"The family.
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”—
Who without more prevarication
Who words and actions will adjust
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
Who would the maiden innocent
Who, heard the music of my lay,
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?”—
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Whom latterly one often meets
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes—
Whom thirty centuries adore.
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Whose author nature understood
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
Whose hands indulgently caress
Whose heart experience icy made
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Whose memory doth not refuse
Whose qualities appeared to afford
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
"Why did you leave last night so soon?”
Why did you visit our poor place?
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Will happiness replace. My God!
Will he pursue?—But no one came.
Will not five centuries exceed
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Will pass; the same to-morrow try—
Will sound an insult in your ear.
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Will you?”—"Agreed.”—"I thank you, friend,”
Winter resigned her empire white,
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Winter's approach she doth not hail
With "vale” finish off a note;
With Ozeroff was wont to share
With affectation,—nothing more.
With all dissatisfaction shows.
With an imagination wild,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
With book in hand reclined in bed,
With cherries, red currants,
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
With dance and with song.
With deeper woe than others' grief.
With fir-trees standing motionless
With footsteps tremulous with awe
With gay design and silken stitch.
With him were friends eternally:
With his ferocious mate appears.
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
With hope and then perplexity,
With hopeless passion: from her bed
With humble prose I'll fill my page
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
With inexact pronunciation
With intellect and strong volition
With intellect, a taste refined,
With iridescent wing doth flap
With its exhilarating flow,
With jealous fire resuscitate,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
With laughter smothered weariness:
With little knowledge and that wrong
With love which happiness extends;
With many a snare their pathway line!
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
With Olga; nor of this appeared
With all their progeny were there,
With ardent sighs and flattery
With bated breath, around she bends
With better half as cumbersome;
With blessings on the ditches and
With clouded brow stands silently?
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
With epigrams impertinent,
With Eugene pranks of former years
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
With eye precise and without fail.
With flame more ardent passion burns,
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
With great delight.—O God on high!
With her they did associate,
With his exasperated sense,
With it may be a couple more;
With jealous fear, anxiety.
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
With loud explosion, the bright wine
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
With many a vacancy, 'tis said.”—
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
With measured step and even gait
With mute appeal to ask they seem—
With one foot resting on its tip
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
With our Onéguine doth aspire
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
With pungent or obtuse retort,
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With quite a lachrymose expression
With rapturous longing he awaits,
With raspberries, cherries.
With roses, caps and looks malign;
With sad refrain misfortune near.
With satisfaction marvellous,
With scandal's trivial ornament.
With serious air then went away
With shame I shudder and with dread—
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
With so much warmth and intellect?
With spiritual tenderness;
With such a perversity proclaim.
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
With taffety instead of crape.
With tears which secret sufferers love—
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,—
With tenderness hath recognized
With the "Well-Wisher” in her hand!
With the epistle of my fair;
With thee I conversed when I bore
With this immoderate request
With this unpleasant tête-à-tête,
With thoughts of a far distant land,
With tranquil air Onéguine leads
With tumult or contentment still
With unanimity complete,
With us 'tis quite a novelty
With us is easily attained.
With what avidity and zest
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
With words of foreign origin
With worldly honours, it may be,
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Within his memory there lay,
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
Within my memory I bore
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Within that secret court discussed,
Without a chance to slip away.
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
Without constraint in conversation
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Without disgust we look upon?
Without enthusiasm he met
Without grammatical mistakes.
Without participation hears,
Without profession, business, wife,
Without the faintest trace to leave
Without the ken of parents both,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Without them Eugene is complete;
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Would at the proper time appear.
Would haste in agitation dire
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Would she in silence long remain.
Would she the canvas tight enrich
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?”—
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Writ in my honour now and then—
Yawning betook him to a pen.
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Ye feel but little interest,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Ye need dissimulation base
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Yea! although rendered beauteous
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Yes, happy—though she at his side
Yet I in idleness expend
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Yet clearer shines than every light
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Yet let us part in friendship, O
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Yet on a frosty winter day
Yet satiated with success,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
Yet sometimes pages two or three
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Yet still apparently aspire
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Yet still remains the old despair.
Yet suffering emotional
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Yonder the household lad doth run,
You choose.”—"But who is she?”—"My wife.”
You fall in love again. But still—
"You have a letter to me sent.
You in the least commiserate
You know that I am now a fool—
You never since your nose have shown.
You never would have heard the name,
You o'er your wine insulted hath—
You will not all abandon me.
You with stern countenance declare
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
You'll spend your winter famously!
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Your conversation cold and hard,
"Your fashionable world I hate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Your innocent and charming note
Your magic voices I shall greet,
"Your second you have left behind!”
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!”—
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Upon the highway of the sea
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
At last the author!” cries Mamma.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
Onéguine's Letter to Tattiana
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”
And silent as the maid Svetlana
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Next Saturday. The Làrina
Verses and tears et cetera.
Bouyànoff whisked off Poustiakova.
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
Each other as the shore we climb!
Opened the portals of the tomb
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
Or for the solitary tomb
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The inmate is for ever dumb,
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
He found them in an almanac,
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
And triumphs in career erotic.
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
Above the ashes of the dead.
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Some are afar and some are dead.
To seek him out with bended head.
Shaking with serious air the head,
Now of a family the head,
Whene'er he had an aching head;
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
All silently hung down his head.
And gently hovered o'er my head?
For patience, reader, I must plead!
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
But on the third of grove and mead
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead—
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
With shame I shudder and with dread—
And it may be a secret dread
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
I slumber much, a little read,
For on their brows I trembling read
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Some nice instructive novel read,
And lessons to his children read.
But presently she tried to read;
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
No other book had time to read.
A little farther please to read
Nor slander viciously could spread
And two old pines their branches spread—
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Thereon the passing traveller read:
But word for word his letter read.
That certain volumes she might read.
I Apuleius gladly read
For the impatient chief instead.
And cool sagacious mind he had:
Although we know that Eugene had
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Inhabited the country, clad
Attentive listened to the lad.
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
He long should have been on the road.
Grant that I err not on the road.”
He dragged her by a forest road
An idle anchorite and sad,
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
In love-lorn meditation sad.
I was incensed and he was sad.
(Mechanically, let us add),
Still certain authors, I may add,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Undressed herself and went to bed
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
With hopeless passion: from her bed
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
And finally, upon his bed
She could not sleep in her new bed.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
Bear gone—she at the threshold placed;
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
The ancient barshtchina replaced
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Except one by the window placed
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
The friends are called and quickly placed.
He on his bosom gently placed
In coach or post-cart duly placed
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
In what he merely acquiesced.
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
At Làrina's abode produced
Most by this circumstance offended
All overtures of friendship ended.
The workpeople she superintended,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
It may be that I did proceed—
Not all will like myself proceed—
Thither in future to proceed
And cares not farther to proceed;
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Will not five centuries exceed
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
Mortally sick I am indeed.
His uncle, busy man indeed,
Remarkable. She then indeed
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
But I perceive thou dost not heed—”
He took no more the slightest heed;
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Up to the attic, and all need
She seeks the garden in her need—
Whither and wherefore do I speed
Had run across her path at speed,
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Nay, near—but destiny decreed—
From the moist cork the bottle freed
And all with one accord agreed,
Alone she gallops on her steed,
On the dull stage find all things changed,
But the date subsequently changed
By visions who was ne'er deranged
The wedding-day had been arranged,
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
A careless looker-on estranged
A breathless silence then, prolonged—
What visions then her fancy thronged—
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
And in society might shed
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed—
Just at that time his father died,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Vice in romance is glorified
Customs by ages sanctified,
A visionary mortified,
But now our minds are mystified
Was with himself dissatisfied.
But in his heart dissatisfied,
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
"Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
Lenski unto the dame replied,
And a new diadem supplied.
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
By other thoughts be occupied.
By a rich pie were occupied—
Longtime her mind is occupied.
The princess from the sofa cried
"I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
And not a speck of dirt descried.
The matter by his conscience tried,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Delusions of a mind untried,
I should alarm our friendship tried:
Successfully to please her tried,
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
And a long time about her talked.
He round the billiard-table stalked,
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
This life in masquerade concealed,
I cannot longer wage concealed.
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
And such unconsciously he led,
A hermit's life Onéguine led,
He conversation would have led—
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
"What ails thee?”—"Nothing.”—He is fled.
Repose her silken curtains fled,
The troop of apparitions fled,
Nay! even as this instant fled,
The pains of night have wholly fled,
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
Of London life is "vulgar” called
Is it that I am now compelled
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
And with remorseful anguish filled,
As if with eider-down is filled.
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!”—
And heard a voice cry—Why! He's killed!—
The channel of the river stilled
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A gambling troop when he controlled,
A life of fact, not fiction, led—
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And to the field of honour led;
Surely ye all have overhauled
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
And in her conversation drawled.
But since to the backdoor they led
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And when the watery mirror gleamed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
She never of deception dreamed
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
A few of different temper deemed,
Onéguine was—so many deemed
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
Both natural and truthful seemed.
And endless the cotillon seemed
That our desires which noblest seemed,
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Feeling in others much esteemed.
A notoriety proclaimed,
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
He thought so, and existence charmed.
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
How soon to habits she conformed
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Only her countenance assumed
The manly toga scarce assumed,
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Where many another hand had signed
And vows will probably be signed:
Her money counted, and designed
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Made revelations undesigned,
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
Caricatures he now designed
That, for the century designed,
Or even, silent and resigned,
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
To arid selfishness resigned,
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Once more to idleness consigned,
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
What do I ask? What cause assigned
A happy destiny ordained:
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
Whose hearts responsive have remained
Rooted unto the spot remained.
Inseparable they remained.
O ye whom tender love hath pained
And saying this Vladimir drained
She consolation thence obtained—
A something somehow have obtained,
At fifty who relief obtained
My sum of happiness contained;
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
Before he eighteen years attained.
With us is easily attained.
The fruits of learning and combined
And handsome countenance combined,
A tender couplet he combined,
With intellect, a taste refined,
His chambers close wherein confined
Love to idealize inclined;
At first for books was disinclined,
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
And on the last one, underlined:
Anticipating woe she pined,
The venerable dame opined
Certain misfortune near opined.
Now a long branch itself entwined
Constant affection intertwined
If the fond hope I could have fanned
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
To his Penates now returned,
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
He on the conflagration frowned.
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Into the cups already sped
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Of his approach; but nothing cared
A countenance perplexed and scared.
An explanation: she was scared,
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Another with cock's head appeared,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
A faithful model she appeared
To an assembly—she appeared
But this a heinous crime appeared
But in the drawing-room all appeared
And Tania's husband soon appeared.—
For evermore had disappeared.
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
My image hath not disappeared,
With Olga; nor of this appeared
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Asunder was and hate prepared?
He went not—sooner was prepared
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared—
Quarrels among young friends he bred
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
And many another slily sneered;
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Their glory with their heels of red
His soul by crash of music fired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
By indolence and languor fired
Singing God knows what maid admired,
To kiss the feet which I admired!
In amorous flights when so inspired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
How like the billow I desired
The fated nutriment desired;
And both of dull existence tired,
I write to you! Is more required?
I long by ballets have been bored,
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Though beauty he no more adored,
His ruffian bravery adored,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
And harmony was soon restored.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
I long enough deceived have erred.
Of the romances she preferred,
And what she from the cards inferred.
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
Tattiana every day conferred
Thus widely meditation erred,
Tattiana through the forest erred,
Of Olga he in song averred;
As Saadi anciently averred—
In the recesses what hath stirred
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
And by a partial temper stirred
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Onéguine's speeches I abhorred
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
He who economy abhorred,
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
Of censure for the same incurred;
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Till proper rings could be procured.
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
At first, but soon became inured
On melted wax in water poured;
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
In fact, some people were assured
Rebuffed—as quickly reassured,
A marriageable maid matured,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
The shining pistols are uncased,
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
More timid than a doe long chased,
The contact of the foot I raised
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
To her an elegy composed.
And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
In love adventures she was versed,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
Alas! for now before her passed
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
At home arriving he addressed
At times three words to him addressed
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
Replaced them in their box, undressed
The style in which my hero dressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
"What ails thee, dear?”—"I feel depressed.
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Are not with elegance impressed.
The image of her seal impressed.
And kindness Tania was impressed,
Onéguine was the most impressed,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
How much is in that word expressed!
So she in French herself expressed.
Not agony, but death expressed.
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
But once more pensive and distressed
Then weeping she sank back distressed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
But tremor still her frame possessed,
The maid whose note he still possessed
If the poor maiden could have guessed
Within that secret court discussed,
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
By friendship how they were abused,
No signs of trouble her accused,
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
Nought in the universe refused:
And though her soul might be confused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Some Russian authors he perused—
A book at early morn perused.
Not that she had his works perused,
The room my former master used.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Even so! His passions soon abated,
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
He ought to have conciliated
By daily life deteriorated,
He might his motives have narrated,
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
Nor long his mind was agitated
Awhile this beauty captivated,
Were to analysis subjected.
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
And life and fate in turn selected
They long at home have her expected—
His visit she had not awaited,
Tattiana with impatience waited
A bastard fame prohibited?
Vladimir Lenski visited
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
By Olga's hand distributed
And every year distributed
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Of what he thought and what believed,
And she at last hath us deceived;
Lenski as a good match received,—
In vain was youth by us received,
Upon those margins she perceived
Retained the image, though short-lived,
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
At an old aunt's they had arrived
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
A new proprietor arrived,
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
Which afterwards the muse revived.
The conversation was revived
Who had for four long years survived
Turned and replied as it behoved,
When but a boy he Olga loved
Perceived that he was still beloved,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Already by repentance moved
Onéguine, by first impulse moved,
And as a country damsel roved,
And these the attentive maid observed
Strictly the Carnival observed,
And ancient usages observed
For first "madame” his wants observed,
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
And numerous pages had preserved
They in a peaceful life preserved
A mien unaltered she preserved,
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
But proudly in his song preserved
The gifted songster never swerved,
And when her violence reviewed—
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
In company, or simply bowed,
Et cetera; but nothing showed
He gazed upon the clock which showed
A scant attendance Lenski showed
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
Onéguine ne'er as poet showed
But from the interview what flowed?
The insensate fire of love still glowed
And privileges nice allowed,
Enraptured was he if allowed
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In correspondence been allowed.
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
And necessary fools allowed.
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Please her by their decorum fixed,
Titles and ages intermixed.
He with his little maiden played,
At prisoner's base she never played.
The deuce with my inside has played.”
The drama of my youth was played.
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
Eight rubbers were already played,
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
Attend in male attire arrayed.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
That we her constantly betrayed
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Change of position had essayed,
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?—
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
And is all light within destroyed?
"What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,
She on the apparition gazed,
Again imagination blazed,
And "Agathon” replied, amazed.
And vehemently though amazed
Which Ovid once immortalized,
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
With tenderness hath recognized
For which the poet agonized
In much his conduct stigmatized;
And long perukes hath vanishèd.
And her upon the threshold laid.
He found him on the table laid,
And many a day thereafter laid
The powder in the pan is laid,
Should go, the market for a maid,
And, hanging down her head, the maid
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
A load of care upon the maid.
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
At early morn returns the maid
Singing inside her hut the maid
She comprehends. The simple maid
My pretty self-deceiving maid—
Remained with him the youthful maid.
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
For shame lift up the modest maid.
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
To classicism I've homage paid,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
Nor frigid adulation paid.
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Onéguine then approached and said:
Gazing into his face, she said:
"Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
What they in conversation said?—
Adieu she to the matron said
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
Though scarcely following what was said,
With many a vacancy, 'tis said.”—
In whispers low the neighbours said:
But finally she softly said:
Vladimir something curtly said
And spectacles, his knitting staid
So be it! Just the laws which bid
Better than Chateaubriand did
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
In mist profound all yet is hid.
Had rendered him an invalid;
Returning, from his ship amid
Wherefore am I your quarry held?—
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
As one who bivouacs afield,
Scornfully challenged you afield—
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
What are they? Gladly would I yield
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
And can it be? But late a child
"What can be done? She is no child!”
An ardent heart and yet so mild?—
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
With an imagination wild,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
The wolf upon the highways bold
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
His mother from the door doth scold.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
He took the room wherein the old
How empires store of wealth unfold,
But that Princess Pauline of old,
I also wandered there of old,
"We never loved in days of old,
These evenings as in days of old
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
The medium is required of gold.
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Some marriageable maids behold,
In one he doth accounts behold,
And the suspicious veteran old,
Tattiana in traditions old
An almanac but eight years old.
In dreams and what the moon foretold
Had killed me had the like been told.”
Her Moscow cousin, often told
And the young ladies fortunes told,
Heard he the truth? And thus she could—
She promised Eugene, or she would
To Olga frequently he would
Of friends unceremonious would
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
Exist—that their immortal band
No one appeared to lend a hand.
Than health, so with a trembling hand
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
With the "Well-Wisher” in her hand!
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Her foot was in my other hand.
Some wretched journal in his hand;
A loaded pistol in his hand.
A weary season was at hand—
Of Africa, ancestral land,
The ruts of his own fatherland.
With thoughts of a far distant land,
When, where, and in what desert land,
Friends of the sons of every land,
And in the bathroom did command
In times gone by thy bare command—”
Sickness more courage doth command
Of a strange night when the moon and—
The poet, modest though so grand,
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
To dream upon the sunny strand
With blessings on the ditches and
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand—
November at the gate did stand.
To see you by our fireside stand,
None the conviction could withstand
Immersed in secret thought I stand
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
At each extreme one takes his stand,
Her tears flow plentifully and
To thy decree my will I bend.
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
A passionate desire to bend
To Love all ages lowly bend,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Wearied of leisure in the end,
And had with waddling in the end
Charms more enduring in the end.
And thou, persistent to the end,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Are admirable, my dear friend,
In duel having killed his friend
Will you?”—"Agreed.”—"I thank you, friend,”
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
If not, the money I will lend.”
An ear to my confession lend;
Their natural attractions lend
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
And they the waters recommend.
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
Yet I in idleness expend
My days of life approach their end,
All to the doctors Eugene send,
"Enough to see one winter's end;
Assistance ever will extend,
Farther Tattiana's walks extend—
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
But finally in wedlock bind.
His mournful heart no peace could find,
The young proprietor we find;
Upon the opening page ye find:
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
But what astonished do I find
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
Infallibly you there will find
But trembles, words he cannot find,
The wood she enters—bear behind,—
Of dreary Russia left behind,
"Your second you have left behind!”
Perchance to benefit mankind,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A duellist of classic mind,
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Had perished a creative mind,
His immorality of mind
From mere vacuity of mind
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
Become alarmed. So never mind!
One image occupied his mind,
But one thought only filled his mind,
It gradually possessed his mind;
Of all the guests within his mind.
Onéguine's pencillings. His mind
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
And the recesses of my mind
That I to you reveal my mind?
So uncongenial to my mind,
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Of whirligigs were very fond,
And stoves of various shapes abound.
Funeral amateurs abound!
However cherries might abound,
What jokes and guesses now abound,
Until her heart less high should bound—
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
The lancer, to his calling bound,
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
She wore her corset tightly bound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
And if Tattiana mine had found—
Lo! in my garden was she found
This monument of thought profound
From hence engrossed in thought profound
(This by command; for it was found,
Examined, mended, newly found
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
But suddenly all changed around!
Imperial portraits hang around
And from the country all around
And devastate the woods around.
Selfish nonentities around?
The German baker looks around
The snows from off the hills around
A tangled wilderness around.
But, when Onéguine's turn came round,
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And flooded all the level ground.
Of horn in circle call them round.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
Congratulations, toasts resound,
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
The Russian N with nasal sound
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
If he had only known the wound
Amid coquettes who pray to God
Will happiness replace. My God!
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Debate commanded ample food—
As to a worthy man and good!
The fruits of science, evil, good,
Such is the country custom good;
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
Absorbed in melancholy mood
But such is not for me. I brood
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Onéguine meditative stood,
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
Lessons to give he understood!
Whose author nature understood
At this time almost understood.
A village and beneath, a wood,
Dark was the valley and the wood
The river through the linden wood.
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
How I have erred and felt the rod!
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”—
Triquet arose, and for the bard
He was no more! The youthful bard
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
In love's campaigns Onéguine heard
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
Her utterances ever heard,
What never was remarked or heard
When in the grand saloon was heard
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
Tattiana would have gladly heard
And ought he not to disregard
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Your conversation cold and hard,
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
A young and handsome galliard.
What doth she see? Around the board
The company deep silence guard.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
He hies unto the "Boulevard,”
She enters a deserted yard—
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Epistle second, note the third,
Whose qualities appeared to afford
She deemed its outline might afford.
Lo! my Onéguine rural lord!
Sighs on another than her lord
To dominate her worthy lord,
Command him not to say a word—
Reform me both in deed and word,
Together they returned, nor word
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Onéguine wasted; on my word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Of late I have been quite absurd,—
No more the music thunders loud,
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And never hath our language proud
Of my light paramour was proud.
Even as Moscow, city proud.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
That girl—but he must dreaming be—
But what a nuisance it will be,
Will to the old times faithful be.
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Feelings which long had ceased to be
I would desire my bride to be—
Is still condemned in love to be;
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
And this fifth canto ought to be
As lordly mansions ought to be,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
As many entertainments be!
"Do not—you might—suspicious be;
Is it a dream, and can it be?
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Or a swift meteor, may be,
(One and the same thing it may be)
Or reconciled them, it may be,
With worldly honours, it may be,
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Inseparable soon they be.
Whilst he "belle Nina” had the face
Time will the ravages efface—
And physic bring with mournful face,
No, ever to behold your face,
I never should have seen your face
Where the first time I saw your face,—
But gazes on Onéguine's face
No more the village knows his face,
Pallid and melancholy face,
"She who with melancholy face
Depicted on your haughty face!
Onéguine—the beloved place
Bright blazed the window of the place,
By "belle Tattiana” to replace.
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
And then "monsieur” supplied her place;
Hard by the window took her place.”—
Why did you visit our poor place?
The damsel under escort place.
Drank to her health in the first place,
To follow you in every place,
And after them at headlong pace
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
"Warm yourself here a little space!”
At the front gates, but in brief space
Accelerates her hasty pace,
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The boy was wild but full of grace.
An ancient lady full of grace.—
Then handed her the song with grace.
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
A print without the picture's grace,
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Inheritor of all his race.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
For there he left a mournful trace.
And my Eugene the path must trace—
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
Of the commencement of the piece.
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
Behold! than polished floor more nice
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
The shining river clothed in ice;
Like his, her dress was always nice,
But wherefore not?—'Tis pleasant, nice,
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
Euphonious, though I know a spice
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
And the extent of his caprice;
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Upon the table in a trice
The excited hero in a trice
But contrary to her advice
Then they're so innocent of vice,
Two poles together glued by ice,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
And his strange conduct at the dance
Again in her ethereal dance?
Before him her wild game of chance.
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
Meeting you in times past by chance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
His momentary loving glance
God grant that all who herein glance,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
Who by a haughty word or glance
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
In groups, official striplings glance
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Or will my melancholy glance
Upon the stage his weary glance.
The days of love and of romance!
And in her hand a French romance.
Canto the First of this romance.
Reviews both dress and countenance,
When people with long countenance
Seek the forgotten countenance
He yawns, averts his countenance,
I heard thy voice's resonance
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
Then would we muse as in a trance,
The hero's name too in advance,
And views amongst themselves advance
Such open-hearted innocence.
Of her provincial innocence
Then to reward such confidence
Tattiana learns the intelligence—
Her amorous experience
He wanders in his indolence;
And natural benevolence,
And aimless journeys did commence—
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Habit would bring indifference.
I yield with a low reverence;
To friendship making no pretence,
I cannot tell on what pretence—
His energy and impotence.
But this adventure's consequence
I, after so much eloquence,
Not to behave as he did once—
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
And the newcomers welcome bade.
And yet oblivion forbade.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
It may be that his martyred shade
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
As in a thicket's humble shade,
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
Was the first question Olga made,
He whom we sing to shall be made
I was for calm existence made,
Straight for the entrance then he made
Though the foul vision promise made
Though late, have a beginning made.
But sad is the reflection made,
But no reply unto her made.
For our amusement ever made
Nor further comment that night made.
Whose heart experience icy made
A certain little escapade
They shovel silver with a spade,
The goddess would a masquerade
Choosing a profitable trade,
Were I like you a bard by trade—
But cannot anyhow evade
And what will Destiny concede?”
For ever faithful will abide.”
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
His fate shall presently decide.
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
But I am now another's bride—
Like Leonora did she ride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
She leisurely away doth ride,
"He promised here this day to ride,”
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
A bearded postillion astride
Unto the windmill he must ride
On horseback every day they ride—
Mute glances interchanged aside
In consultation stand aside—
But now all doubt was set aside,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
And soon Onéguine's door beside
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
And glittering simpletons beside;
A pair of bullets—nought beside—
And hastened to his uncle's side,
Yes, happy—though she at his side
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
But grown familiar side by side
Found them in darkness side by side,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
Jaws are at work. On every side
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Always together, eventide
Meet punishment for him provide.
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
And death before the husband wide
And the saloon threw open wide;
Onéguine oped the cupboards wide.
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Of a most mournful episode,
To foreign lands he would allude,
And unto whom we all allude
Deep in the distant province rude,
Upon my visions such intrude.
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
Secure in rural quietude—
Then, then—well, in some solitude
Before whom once in solitude,
Where long time he in solitude
Daily of love in solitude.
In worldly din or solitude
Since Eugene in that solitude
Fly frequent to my solitude,
My soul is filled with gratitude!
Measured with great exactitude.
Displayed a noble rectitude—
My scholar without aptitude
To part in amity with thee!
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
Then, I say truly, none but thee
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
By Providence's dark decree!
This lot in life with stern decree?
Tender and elevated, free?
When shall I wing my passage free
From such digressions wholly free.
Impressed him in the least degree,—
Perchance he will to all the three.
Yet sometimes pages two or three
His valet brings him letters three.
Tome of "Malvina,” and but three
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
The poet's hour hath sounded—See!
The house and garden I would see.”
And a guitar produced we see,
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing—see!
Virgins miraculous I see,
Know that thy face that day I see.
The giddy world at last shall see.
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
He usually was glad to see
"Olinka is her junior, see.
The break of day she doth not see,
The letter is the thing, you see,—
A mansion—by the window, see!
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Such was Onéguine's sainted life,
To move in fashionable life,
He in the early years of life
Who floats contentedly through life,
Commence a new career in life
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
And like his shadow dogged his life,
In many things had changed his life—
He knew not how to spend his life.
Should be respected throughout life
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
And leads a solitary life?
And rest from bygone days of strife.
So be it! But internal strife
In aimless ease and far from strife,
Of error and the passions' strife.
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
By every proper-minded wife,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
Wherein the miserable wife
Or better,—like a faithful wife.
By children and by faithful wife
That I am rich, a prince's wife?—
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
Without profession, business, wife,
You choose.”—"But who is she?”—"My wife.”
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
But at a later, sterile age,
In boston and the game of age,
And testy gamesters do engage
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
Or in a squabble to engage,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
Another could her heart engage,
A visionary personage
As once, to fill the rapid page
Saint Priest, who every album's page
Or faults of grammar on its page—
With humble prose I'll fill my page
As storms which in chill autumn rage
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
As the reflection of his age,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Another could her woe assuage
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
For two whole days it seemed a change
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
Placed at the customary range;
No one the contrary will urge,
Again a century should scourge
Unto his own Tattiana he,
The traveller, bird of passage he,
That girl whom once on a time he
For empty sound the rascal swore he
A paragon of virtue he!
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Three mortal hours per diem he
Tania well nigh expired when he
And by a sweet delusion he
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
Voices and hands applaud, and she
And in her native language she
And a half rubles down gave she;
Nor on the letter yet hath she
"Oh! I remember, where is he?”—
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
And disappear in space; then she
She sits alone—'tis ever she!
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
And an encouragement did breathe
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
They first of all my brow did wreathe
No fond illusions live to soothe,
A dying man with art to soothe,
Men love no more, as only the
On Sundays by yon window he,
Dressed like a London dandy he
Before you agonized to die—
And silently I here must die—
The family of children hie.
Upon the earth a mist did lie
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
Contemplate her sad reverie.
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Dark, unavailing reverie,
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
Unknown to all, without a tie,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
The fever of the blood to slake—
Her promptings unto law did make,
I the same admonition make.
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Acquaintance instantly to make.
E'en as the presence of a snake,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
Great sacrifices for his sake!
For law I far niente take
My sportive Muse I used to take
And every morning I awake
To burn, yet reason keep awake
Or any trifle else ye like
Pedantic although scholar like,
Of the horizon she is like!”—
"The post hath kept him, it is like.”
By computation) it is like
Onéguine waits on us, 'tis like.”
The comrade of your youth should strike,
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
Then suddenly discharge a joke
A bogy conjured up in joke,
And barely visible the smoke
How artless was the note which spoke
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
And Lenski followed—a light broke—
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
Tattiana terrified awoke.
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Already sings the nightingale.
Nor the frost particles inhale
But now in her effulgence pale
She, than the morning moon more pale,
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Onéguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
Thus we began our little tale—
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Thus in a style obscure and stale,
I tried when I began this tale,
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
I know there's none more amiable.
Fashion is there immutable,
Honour and pride inflexible.
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Regained authority awhile,
Singing in chorus all the while.
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
To see aught—never mind meanwhile)
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
Espying, Eugene with a smile
As rosy lips without a smile,
They crack a feeble joke and smile—
That afterwards with evil smile
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Cannot they amicably smile
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
But he desired not to beguile
Shall my declining years beguile;
The Russian language I deem vile
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
About the rain and flax and cattle.”—
In their sterility of prattle,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
I owe the censorship a little.
But will not modify a tittle—
The crystals of her vestibule
Though correspondence as a rule
Careless of every social rule,
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Avenge himself in proper style.
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
In solid, unpretentious style,
And a romance in ancient style
The door flew open—Olga came,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Tattiana faltered, and became
Nor by her beauty she became
Because a member I became.
From Gottingen inspired he came,
And straight returning whence he came,
"And is it long since back he came?
Will he pursue?—But no one came.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
But when the winter season came
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Athwart the snow four paces came—
Her shoulder—Olga swiftly came—
But turn we once more to our dame.
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
And comfort of each country dame,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
In hopes of everlasting fame
And at the altar of their fame
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
Strange unto her each childish game,
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Trembles at artificial shame.
By recklessness amuse or shame
Believe me, of my present shame
That vicious set whom I don't blame—
He kindled his poetic flame.
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
By love's inevitable flame.
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
Is it that ardent souls of flame
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
More blooming than the Boreal flame
But fashionable hatred's flame
And in addition youth is flame
We are the first who such a name
You never would have heard the name,
And so Tattiana was her name,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A finished madrigal would frame
She waits, on fire her trembling frame—
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Pray is it he? It is the same.
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
The old Derjavine noticed me,
His character attracted me.
And fled afar—she followed me.
Of many an economic scheme;
And my romance's open theme
The olden time shall be my theme.
And then the stanzas of my theme
Who reads his visionary theme
Of touching lightly every theme.
He with an innocence extreme
Descends the bank with care extreme,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
﻿"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
And, inspiration firing me,
Until the sleepless Bréguet chime
Transported to our Russian clime.
And visit many a foreign clime,
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
His footing on the treacherous rime
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
She is an angel! We sometime
For a protracted space of time.
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Her figure perfect grows with time!
Announcing to him dinner-time.
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
It now to investigate is time,
How in the country pass this time?
And may fall headlong any time.
You will not all abandon me.
Despair and anger seize on me,
Across her youth a shade had come,
Tiresome unto her hath become
All dark and silent hath become;
Callous to all on earth become—
And shorter had the days become.
Straight from their province had he come?”—
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Though to the Academy I come
When will my hour of freedom come!
In winter time would often come.
Nor shall the caterpillar come
At eventide would hither come,
He wakes—they with a letter come—
Triumphant with the answer come.
To take a hand at whist oft come:
His name: the tenderness of home
Yes! for our unpretending home,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
Long, long the hour had past when home
No longer through her former home;
Time was, two maidens from their home
The Princess N. will be at home
Homeward returning, he at home
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
The bard his answer waits at home,
With better half as cumbersome;
That first the Muse appeared to me.
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
Mournful is thine approach to me,
But I—what is all this to me?
What is thy cleverness to me?
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”—
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
Open the window—sit by me.”
In the lone garden and the lane?
Oft staring through the window pane
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Undeviating and insane
Of the domains of the side-scene.
Struck Lenski dead—across the scene
But shall depict the touching scene
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
The village wherein yawned Eugene
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Such were the musings of Eugene.
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
"My second!” cried in turn Eugene,
All this was novel to Eugene.
He was in error; for Eugene
"And is it,” meditates Eugene.
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
She rose—departed. But Eugene
And so departed. But Eugene,
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
Between myself and my Eugene,
As a poetic life serene,
And irrigate them with champagne;
Are turned upon her. All combine
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
"Departed Lenski here to dine
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
Behold the dames who once were fine
A single being: 'twas in fine
The sneers of critics superfine;
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,—
And make a dark existence shine
The lamps illuminating shine;
He could in disputation shine
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”—
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
"Aline!”
Diminishes as years decline.
Do all things which to mirth incline.
The kennel or a kindred line,
Akulka who was once Celine,
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
Corset and album and Pauline,
With many a snare their pathway line!
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
No other than Onéguine mine.
Well known unto Onéguine mine.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Bouyànoff, wrathful cousin mine,
In your young days and also mine),
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
Please follow this way, lady mine,
Of my impassioned heroine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Never upon my heroine
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
Is it for long?”—"Ma chère cousine!”
Tattiana's Letter to Onéguine
Lest the world or her lord divine
Before the dregs they shall divine
Another bard with art divine
Long tortured by his lay divine,
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
About the crop of hay, the wine,
Give me just half a glass of wine—
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine—
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helène,
The sum of my existence gone
All to the grand saloon are gone—
To pass the night at home hath gone.
Can she have been a moment gone
The ball in all its splendour shone.
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
That hero, though his merit shone,
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Having for money's sake alone
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
Certainly not Eugene alone
When, sitting by his fire alone
'Twas these he read and these alone
To sigh and meditate alone:
Can hearty welcome give alone.
In horror for itself alone,
Upon her brow sits wrath alone—
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
Waiting his coming—his alone!
Moina recalls for this alone
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
And in the frosty night alone
That mediocrity alone
Forgotten in the village lone,
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Though around honoured Priam's throne
"Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.
Said something in an undertone
She murmurs in an undertone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
That all may hear his voice's tone.
That like a friendly voice its tone
But that the eyes of every one
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
No answer all that day was borne.
A constant harping on one tune,
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
The aged woman in her woe:
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
Or quietly partake our woe.
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
With taffety instead of crape.
Could in romantic mantle drape
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
'Tis dreadful—ye agree, I hope—
Had bid her sigh for without hope—
In country solitude you mope,
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
His inner consciousness laid bare,
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
Was he in health and void of care?—
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Albums magnificent which scare
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
Lenski at intervals would dare,
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
The vile seducer shall not dare
Though I confess I hardly dare
O Men, how very like ye are
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
With Ozeroff was wont to share
And impiously should declare,
You with stern countenance declare
I cannot help it I declare,
None could her beautiful declare,
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
The riot of the world and glare
The crash of music, candles' glare
And the more surely we ensnare
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Here I remark all poets are
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
Which in the elevated sphere
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here.
"Abandon hope for ever here!”
She sank.—"He's here! Eugene is here!
(I speak not of our poems here),
And Eugene soon discovered there
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
With all their progeny were there,
Alone the princess sitteth there,
I promised!—Did I so?—Well, there!
Tattiana gently led them there.
The young Simeonova too there
It may be ye were born, or there
And yet the city's flower was there,
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?”—
And lo! he is already there!
Was born beside the Neva, where
He bends his course to Talon's, where
Faces which we meet everywhere
And be not in advance severe.
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Just as he entered. How severe!
If the choice in my power were,
And dark and drear the evenings were,
As if impossible it were
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
Olga with trepidation dire.
Would haste in agitation dire
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
And spouted it with lyric fire—
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Authors replete with sacred fire
Or bosom full of languid fire,—
The proud ones are not worth the fire
For our Automedons are fire
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
Their privileged allurements fire
With our Onéguine doth aspire
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
Yet still apparently aspire
And that no longer could inspire.
He deemed his coming would inspire
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
Raged round him and of balked desire!
To mutter her concealed desire
A hidden train of wild desire.
All that perfection could desire;
All that a poet could desire,
He felt the laudable desire
This world. I do not praise desire,
So ardently did I desire
Which glowed with virginal desire.
But Lenski, having no desire
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
At a great feast against desire,
Slowly exhausted by desire,
His constant soul could ever tire,
And our swift troikas never tire;
The wit of others to acquire.
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
Opened with care, and entering bore
With thee I conversed when I bore
Within my memory I bore
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
The Russian winter did adore
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
Whom thirty centuries adore.
And the young girl appeared before
He was deceived. Just as before
He read as vainly as before,
My spirit with such pangs before.
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
How oft to the Crimean shore
To help her to the other shore
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
And thy protection I implore.
Society renounced once more.
With it may be a couple more;
With affectation,—nothing more.
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
As if against obstruction sore
A gust of passion never tore
Away her golden earrings tore;
Endowing us from out her store
As bees who leave their dainty store
And homeward like an arrow tore.
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Bouyànoff too, my cousin, wore
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
"But which, my dear?—In days of yore
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
For who imposture can endure,
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
But competition I abjure
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
Then my companions young with pleasure
In history he took no pleasure,
Found out the secret how at pleasure
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
For long—for ever. To be sure
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
He will delight you, I am sure,
That my dishonour would ensure
Serious endeavours to assure
Happy who timely grew mature,
And after Albion's proud lyre
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
Ye need dissimulation base
Felled a calumniator base!
For my wild garden and bookcase,—
That a friend's arm in every case
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
The journey in a sledge doth please,
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?”
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Possession hath no power to please,
Napoleon tarried till it please
O epic Muse, my powers increase
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
Of modern Russians the disease.
A very troublesome disease,
If seriously he hath disease;
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
In motley and amusing chase.
The curs away to kennel chase,
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Not even a poetic phrase,
I say without poetic phrase,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Address to you one single phrase
To russify the foreign phrase
Who every gesture, every phrase
Eugene would speak regarding these.
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
From careless stanzas such as these,
She would pronounce à la Française;
She mourned and to the moon would raise
And in her languid bosom raise
Of passion they so often raise.
To God eternal hymns of praise.
As cyphers others to appraise,
Away! and cease to ring their praise
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
And where the billows hoarsely raise
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Because he could not gourmandise
They growl a bit—they scandalise—
Crushing and a confusing noise;
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Miraculously fair arise,
Where melancholy rocks arise
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of the night sentinels arise
And would by candlelight arise.
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
The Làrinas were since sunrise
Late in the afternoon to rise,
The shopman and the pedlar rise
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
He has returned, say in what guise?
Olga the tea must supervise—
He is a charming youth and wise.
Olga began to long likewise
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Man—forty years long in this wise—
But now a question in this wise
With his exasperated sense,
May be the empire of the sense,
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Pervaded with much common sense.
And I admired their common sense
Reduced with effort unto sense,
Though now my love might be intense,
Inspired but weariness intense;
We hear with interest intense
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
A curious interest disclose
Malignant fury they disclose,
The windows whitened, shutters close—
"Command me, darling, what you choose”—
But nowhere can she find repose,
Do agitate his late repose.
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
When, wise at length, we seek repose
And where at last his bones repose
But better loved the soft repose
Her smile and maidenly repose,
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
He enters. High the cork arose
And the conviction soon arose,
Furious he from the table rose;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
As many dinners I rehearse,
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
And also that my feeble verse—
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
Round which revolves the universe.
That for that matter in my verse
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
Detecting him the passing horse
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
Most usually a Cossack horse
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
In age the memory gets worse,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Existence would not make a curse,
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
All visited him at first, of course;
A dinner, whimsical each course,
Of friends the grateful intercourse—
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
Oh, many a year hath run its course
I lift a warning voice because
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
Now I am ready to refuse.
Whose memory doth not refuse
But look you—ah! do not refuse.”
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Poetic transport did infuse,
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
The monsters of the British Muse
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
A mournful temper on his Muse.
But I the products of my Muse,
Now for the first time I my Muse
Incited by his stormy Muse
But I must now employ my Muse
Ye mothers also, caution use,
One instrument for his own use—
Now, as in a deserted house,
Then became busy with the house,
"What can be drearier than the house,
Received him freely at her house,
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Night separated from her spouse,
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
The drum already doth arouse.
To my old nurse alone peruse,
But Olga would not such peruse.
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
But what results? His eyes peruse
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
They long ago had held debate.
They would not solemnly debate
My famous portrait indicate
But this amusement delicate
I married—now, I supplicate—
"Advance!”—Indifferent and sedate,
The Lovelaces are out of date,
All this I know is out of date,
That is, he could elucidate
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
He was most gay. The happy date
The story of thy life and fate.
Indifferent was her future fate.
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
The servants used to congregate
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
The hostess doth interrogate:
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
Both were expectant of the hate
"Your fashionable world I hate,
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
With her they did associate,
Both were of passion satiate
Excruciate the heart and late
(Like other things I could relate)
Sometime collected, shall relate
But if the truth I must relate,
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
"He hath neglected us of late.”—
The time for mystic strolls which late
Desirous to annihilate
In charming fashion mutilate?
How soon he learnt to titillate
But round the hostess scintillate
That year the autumn season late
Two hearts perchance were desolate
But now my mind is desolate,
Longtime was her heart desolate
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
A mild quotation to translate,
A promenade in twilight late
And you, O maids immaculate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
But I came not to adulate:
The world enough. Congratulate
And jests doth recapitulate.
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Conscious of death approximate,
Just at the hour we designate
And, joy of souls effeminate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
Of life or death predestinate.
I had found my predestinate,
And stupid censors passionate;
Perchance one more affectionate.
He marmot-like did hibernate,
Must be pronounced unfortunate—
But if my lot unfortunate
And grasp a stirrup fortunate—
By time (who can anticipate?)
'Tis fearful to anticipate
For evermore is separate.
The Làrinas would celebrate,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,—
To whom we used to consecrate
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Her manners were deliberate,
Spoiled children most degenerate
But merely to exasperate;
You in the least commiserate
Or "Idol mio,” and in the grate
His double sashes and his grate,
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
If cleverly or not I prate.
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
By an obrok's indulgent rate:
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
Your frankness I shall compensate
With jealous fire resuscitate,
On thee I used to meditate!
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
The matter did not agitate,
Eternally to imitate
The secrets of the marriage state
By rank as settled by the State.
The sorrows of a single state.
These take their seats; the coach of state
I am not strong enough to state;
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
My heart of old would captivate.
My soul I cannot renovate—
In bud of promise incomplete,
The weary way still incomplete,
Around my stanzas incomplete
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
Without them Eugene is complete;
Encountered punishment complete,
Who the romance do not complete,
With unanimity complete,
"Me?”—"Yes! It is Tattiana's fête
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
The fervid poet would recite,
When poets lachrymose recite
Was certainly not erudite
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
A bottle of a vintage white
Winter resigned her empire white,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
Its ebullition foaming white
All so distinct, and all so white!
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Their insolence and waistcoats white
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The converse of the world polite,
Highways all Russia will unite
Happy who thereto can unite
The girl in marriage they unite.
Nor even tears afford respite,
I have endured without respite.
Trembles upon my lips from spite,—
A philosophic anchorite:
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Who thrives this moment as I write,
But I must add to what I write
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
Beyond this may attempt to write.
Serve who could neither read nor write.
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
And irritates the appetite.
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
By Olga stood, dejected quite
A Russian household simple quite,
Affection how did you requite?
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
And town and friends forgotten quite.
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
The vestibule finds empty quite—
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Fond declarations they invite
On innocent delights I dote,
I on my chosen hero dote;
On balls I madly used to dote,
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
With "vale” finish off a note;
Or the delivery of a note.
Interrogation to denote.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Your innocent and charming note
A dagger, asterisk, or note
To purest love he tuned his note
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
When in simplicity ye wrote
And an elegiac poem wrote.
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
So let us to the ball-room haste,
And the attendants called in haste.
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
We must admit but little taste
All which in Paris eager taste,
More satisfaction to her taste.
And she despite herself would waste
And ease and fashionable waste,—
And education runs to waste,
This anchorite amid his waste
"Princesse, mon ange!”—"Pachette!”—
Subscribed, toujours à vous, Annette;
With this unpleasant tête-à-tête,
And the cast-iron statuette
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Device of rural minds acute!)
In the beginning, cold and mute,
From whose analysis minute
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
My country's honour and repute
None could a trace of that impute,
Her all in all did constitute;
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Did they not all the Russian tongue
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Onéguine knew enough, the rogue
Latin is just now not in vogue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
He racked his brains to find its clue
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!”
His vanity first let us pique
Thou also, my ideal true,
Ah! it may be, affection true
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
No novelty—is it not true?—
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
I did not please you. Why pursue
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Without the faintest trace to leave
And all without her husband's leave.
But now our hero we must leave
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
Into delicious bondage gave
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
But promise of our meeting gave,
Was it not so?—for thee I gave,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
A first success light pinions gave,
Alarm the winter journey gave.
The prejudices all men have,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave—
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
He sang of love—to love a slave.
To shallow sentiment a slave!
A prudent man like you and brave
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
My guardian angel to the grave.
For him an honourable grave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But where Melpomene doth rave
The moderns of the ancients rave—
The Lord deliver her and save!
And thy inebriating wave
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Thus to assassinate the eve?”—
But my Onéguine the whole eve
To mention the foregoing eve,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
To standards in which we believe?
These are your relatives, believe:
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Just at a moment which I grieve
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
He called upon me Christmas Eve—
Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
To jest as he had done last eve,
I love you—to what end deceive?—
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
Where is he who doth not deceive?
And that too often we receive
What I by relatives conceive?
"Not at all.”—"That I can't conceive!
His son is married, just conceive!”
In clouds of steam above perceive.
To write in cantos twenty-five.
To me he would his Olga give,
Of "comme il faut.” Shishkòff, forgive!
Time without me will lessons give,
But I await thee: scarce alive
The most industrious man alive
Us from the world wherein we live.
Would whisper: shall I so long live?”—
So meantime let him joyous live
Depart in peace and friendly live?
And our successors soon shall drive
Mutual destruction to contrive.
And yet he in your cause would strive
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
What boots it with the age to strive?
And loves you as—a relative!
Applause, the people's donative.
I can't translate the adjective.
There our Katènine did revive
My heart with but one look revive;
Along the hall, and high above
That guests approach: and when above
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
None, be my witness Heaven above!
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
And enmity and hope and love—
Again the plague of boyhood—love?
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
The all-entrancing joys of love—
To swagger as the art of love,
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
Extended—haunt which Dryads love.
By absence who hath chilled his love,
I love you with a brother's love,
With tears which secret sufferers love—
The malady of hopeless love
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
My spirit and my blood doth move,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
Maidens before her meekly move
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
A thick immense neglected grove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And in the Summer Garden rove.
Gently for pranks he would reprove
If Olga smilingly approve,
Time was when cold seduction strove
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
Desire to rule ye may observe
Polite demeanour to preserve,
To strike imagination serve.
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
Him who inspired both love and awe,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Striking the intellect with awe
And supper. In the country we
When the hour came to bid good-bye—
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
And reads with rapid eager eye
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
The cynosure of every eye.
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
Onéguine whither gallops? Ye
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
On everything around her gaze,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And long her eyes as through a haze
Extinguished ashes do not blaze—
No, never in the early blaze
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
"But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Him a disquietude did seize,
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Nor the first snow of winter seize
The hero we immortalize.
Who now could fail to recognize
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
Having lost all in life we prize.
The calm existence which I prize
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
They made him feel inclined to doze;
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And who is not a tiresome thief?
And honestly 'tis my belief
Is ever ready with relief,
This great discovery relief
Habit alleviates the grief
Who in the agony of grief
To whom are our misfortunes grief
With deeper woe than others' grief.
Our union would produce but grief.
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
Gvozdine, Bouyànoff, Pétòushkoff
The family of Kharlikoff,
But stop! I will present thee, if
To write of any other elf
Than one's own fascinating self.
Then dressed himself...
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Even beneath her parents' roof
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
The language of her girlish pleading
Page after page continued reading,
However, Tania's letter reading,
But she, her sister never heeding,
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Espy him approaching,
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!”
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
Onéguine's letter!”—"Ah! the thing!
I guard it as a holy thing,
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
Basins and jugs—well! everything
Also one Viázemski, remarking
And an old gent the poet marking
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But why are your cheeks whitening?”
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
The world is ever altering!
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
Or, parable more flattering,
Amidst successes flattering
To our Tattiana conquering,
Upon the meadows showering,
Some other long-departed Spring,
And now she skips and now she spring
Ye golden days of my young spring?
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
In life domestic see a string
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Behold! orthography despising,
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,—
At last my father gave his blessing,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Follow up love—a secret meeting
To happiness contributing.
Wafted upon poetic wing,
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Of pictures painful harrowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
Metreless verses recognizing
Existence calmly sped along,
Who following Petrarch move along
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The days which to your youth belong?
But send your grandson before long.”
Glittered in a perspective long,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
She gazed—a cue, forgotten long,
And grant success to labour long;
He thought to write, but labour long
The lively trash of stories long
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
The nightingale there all night long,
"The date, his fleeting years how long—
Terpsichore alone among
And thus he never fell among
And wild festivities among
And oft at eventide a throng
He quits the fashionable throng
To whom amongst the jealous throng
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
With little knowledge and that wrong
Repose in peace, thou child of song.”
She brought with her the gift of song.
With dance and with song.
And led me off to church with song.”
Either with him or thee in song,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
A double force unto their song
The Maidens' Song
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Let me explain that in my song
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
Enough! my pack is now unslung—
Since I beheld Eugene and young
"I celebrate a comrade young
Her sisterhood delights the young
Were you in love when you were young?”—
Or letters of a maiden young.
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Happy he who in youth was young,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
His harp beneath that sky had rung
He who life's frosts which early wrung
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
His entrance with Onéguine. "Ah!
Make up your mind to go there.”—"Ah!
The native Russian tongue impeach?
Thus did our friend Onéguine preach:
How meekly then I heard you preach—
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To-day it is my turn to teach.
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Alas! with merited reproach.
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
But ultimately doth approach.
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Her antiquated mode of speech,
Did not their lips with foreign speech
Attentive listened to his speech,
Many an ancient legend which
Would she the canvas tight enrich
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
Who to surrender did not blench
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
But home his body to despatch
With gay design and silken stitch.
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
I formerly admired her much
No coquetry was there, I vouch—
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
Society endures not such!
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
With great delight.—O God on high!
"I call to witness God on high—”
Sails her allotted course on high,
And many a caravan on high
The tiny sun shone less on high
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Careless of fame his spirit high
And from the misty woodland nigh
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
List! the snow crunches—he draws nigh!
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
When separation's hour drew nigh,
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Heaved an involuntary sigh
There is no wreath upon the bough:
In scenes like these it may be though,
How dark the night is getting though!
His breast was riddled through and through,
And the eternal lorgnette through
To guess how you the eve pull through.”—
My venerated reader, oh!
They sent their compliments—but oh!
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And pressed her hand—the crimson blush
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
He lies, upon his forehead death,
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
Above the humble urn of death.
Affectionately yours till death.
Or counting on his uncle's death
Who early died a gallant death,”
When motionless your gaze beneath
"Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
Would agitate a mystic wreath
And what the old man might bequeath.
You o'er your wine insulted hath—
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
Or even overcome by wrath
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
Without the ken of parents both,
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
But memory like a serpent's tooth
The dusty chronicles of earth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
To dire contentment shall give birth
He salutary rules poured forth?
"Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
By the fine silver of the north.
For him were but of little worth,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
The last poor obol I was worth—
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
Restrained the impulses of youth;
To the impressions of our youth,
My frivolous and jolly youth.
Found the ideal of my youth,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
In that morass where you and I
My word of honour given have I.
But were it not immoral I
"Not in the least, assured am I!”—
"My darling, growing old am I!
Imagine! Here alone am I!
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
Another! to none other I
But with her elder sister I
But who abandon it—as I
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
In former years thus did not I
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
To listen to the words you speak,
Vows matrimonial to break,
Incessantly his chains to break.”
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
Bruin is marching at her back!
And the sagacious Triquet back
Himself transformed into a hack;
Passes the torrent But alack!
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
In truth he had the happy trick
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick—
And he had made her heart beat quick!
He loved the simpleton to mock,
The artful prisoner should seek
And thus secures the prey we seek.
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
At times, if only once a week,
They have invited you this week.”
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
And then a cup of coffee drank,
A door he opens. But why shrank
He's a freemason, so we think.
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Alone he doth his claret drink,
Vladimir closes up his book,
Was uttered, and the cabin shook—
His fist Onéguine fiercely shook
Into accounts would sometimes look,
But somehow there shone in his look
How bright and tender was his look,
To flight before her radiant look,
Calling to mind your icy look
And shut him in a lonely nook.
The little solitary nook
His course unto the running brook.
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
How thoroughly her part she took!
And flowed harmoniously. He took
To ask her name the trouble took.
And clad in airy costume took
An honourable course ye took,
Jealousy and vexation took
Caught him and by the collar took
Till absently Vladimir took
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
Assemblies oligarchical
They deem her somewhat finical,
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Ye men of fashion cynical,
And female tears hysterical,
Already he grew phthisical.
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Economy political,
A fop, in dress pedantical.
And cannot anything conceal,
Of untold gain she must conceal,
When the mazurka used to peal,
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
What sad emotions o'er me steal
What will the coming dawn reveal?
For promises her feet reveal
Outlandish and provincial,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
And with gray hair ambrosial
Lo! with what pride celestial
Nought of its charms original
Yet suffering emotional
He deemed of human life the goal
The path which leads to glory's goal.
And others rise ephemeral!
The eyes of a grave general.
Behind her a grave general.
A ball in Peter's capital,
In one thing really did excel.
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
When first upon my cheek I feel
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
On him spleen mounted sentinel
To such—delightful to repel.
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Until her powers of running fail.
Though of romance therein I fail
With eye precise and without fail.
In time I'll give ye without fail
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Winter's approach she doth not hail
The sharp incisions of his nail,
Within its wave the sounding pail,
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
A true account and in detail.
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail—
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
God grant I meet not at a ball
Another tribune of the ball
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
She soon forgot, began to call
Was that which we are wont to call
So, when he came next day to call,
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
The rigour of cold pride and all
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
And finally he deigns let fall
They blossom, ripen and they fall
A whisper runs along the hall,
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Some future ignoramus shall
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
For long he had endured them all.
Nor years of separation all
Bedding is laid out and to all
Indifferent he became to all,
A white and undulating pall
The snow descends and buries all,
Her sentimental verses all,
The twilight pale which softens all,
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Morality taught scarce at all;
They shout and no one lists at all.
Was not surprised thereby at all.
He knits his brows—'tis silent all.
I envied sore the billows tall,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
Hung like a print against the wall,
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Long in this fashionable cell
For consecrate to me he fell
The lady's glance upon him fell—
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
Repentance wields not now her spell
Of languor and of love did tell
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
For your instruction here to tell
The steward sent a note to tell
"I am in love,” her whispers tell
I am—in love—you know—don't tell!”
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell—
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
At thirty who was married well,
A worthy object 'tis, and well
I have no leisure here to dwell,
Ennui can in the country dwell
And think: here lies who loved me well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
And wished to say to him farewell.
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
"The family are all quite well—
Are all your relatives quite well?
How thy hands burn!”—"Dear nurse, I'm well.
To take this letter to O— Well!
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
His relative and friend as well.
And gallicisms I love as well
And sometimes into snares as well
This separated us as well—
Pétòushkoff, the provincial swell;
At twenty who was prig or swell,
"My heart's delight, thou art not well.”—
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Onéguine acted very well
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill—”
My unpretending page shall fill,
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Proceeds, until she from a hill
The pervert world with icy chill
And wisely gallops to the hill.
Let us proceed unto a rill,
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
To listen to the rippling rill.
A garden by a shining rill.
"'Tis habit, Lenski.”—"Is your ill
An hour passed by—another—till,
His heart reciprocated still
The coach before a house stood still.
Domestic life attracts me still,
"How now, Onéguine, yawning still?”—
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
To wander through the meadows still,
With tumult or contentment still
You fall in love again. But still—
Time was, the poet's tender quill
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Thus a guest with composure will
(See the first canto if ye will),
To stay the maid against her will.
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
As in their turn the seasons roll.
Perchance they laurels also cull—
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
Rings from a dish of water full
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
In order due the maidens pull;
You know that I am now a fool—
At eighteen not to play the fool!
He was a dear delightful fool—
He used to hate—and was no fool—
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
Conventionality's dull tool—
Learn to possess more self-control.
"Monsieur l'Abbé” a starving Gaul,
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
And Eugene ever in her soul
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
And now philanthropy his soul,
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
Of your perfections in my soul,
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
And a boy handed round the cream.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
But Tania just as in a dream
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Eugene at first began to dream,
The story of his young love's dream,
To the fair object of his dream,
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
All this may be an empty dream,
Tattiana in a misty dream,
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
Awaiting on the shore I roam
A wish from place to place to roam,
Back to his regiment must roam.
'Twould serve ye in an epigram—
And a malicious epigram
And love's delicious diadem
Merciful God, what will he deem?”
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
Providence otherwise may deem—
Of priceless value all things seem
With mute appeal to ask they seem—
He hath acquired the world's esteem
But, as he never opened them,
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
Is ever ready to proclaim
With such a perversity proclaim.
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
In winter by its blank and dim
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
And the lime alley's twilight dim
Of what not, and of distant dim,
But could not. Then she questioned him:—
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Where the first time she met with him.
Its driver seated on the rim
From first to last page to the rim.
He sang of separation grim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
A country damsel's album trim,
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
In some a willing martyrdom.
"Is she in love?” quoth one. "With whom?
She waited for—I don't know whom!
Pétòushkoff met the selfsame doom.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!”—
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
The forests in mysterious gloom
This is my master's sitting-room.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
"Had he been long here, and where from?
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monster's arm,
The amatory science warm,
In thy imagination warm,
Fantastic images shall swarm
Laid down his life of sun and storm
A Russian poem's mechanism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
Indeed, by force of magnetism
How like a poet was my chum
He "Benedetta” used to hum,
He had excepted from the ban:
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Romances three, in which ye scan
'Twas plain—an oaken floor ye scan,
A new acquaintance we must scan.
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
Onéguine slowly then began
And my Tattiana now began
Zaretski, village mechanician,
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
"How came you then to wed a man?”—
Vladimir's property, a man
At last became a ruined man.
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Let me present ye to the man,
He was an honest gentleman,
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Portrayed contemporary man
Eugene directs the trusty man
Four deadly paces do they span;
I feel, allotted is my span;
Deep into debt his father ran;
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
Portray the solitary den
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
In her friends' albums, time had been,
There friends of pure delight had been
Assuredly should not have been
The butt of scandal having been,
Had a deluded victim been
A fond and careful mother been.
Obedient she had ever been
And fields my joys have ever been;
Which never have existed, e'en
Become a faithful wife and e'en
"Come,” she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
Repose from labour, satire keen,
What a storm of emotions keen
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
Was nothing but the British spleen
The lonely mansion-house to screen
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
As your light footprints on the green.
In springtime on the meadows green,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
To this arrangement can be seen,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
The torment born of crime unseen,
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”—
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before him red roast beef is seen
But nothing changed in them is seen,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
In little maidens of thirteen?
His malady, whose cause I ween
Writ in my honour now and then—
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
"Onéguine, I was younger then,
His friendship I acquired just then;
The cold reply with gloomy mien
Approach not to hearken
The tale of these romantic men;
To pass with reasonable men
E sempre bene, gentlemen!
Amid submissive herds of men
Whom, as the custom is of men,
Having abjured the haunts of men,
And isolated from all men,
So inaccessible to men,
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
The poet fell; already men
Yawning betook him to a pen.
I know that Parny's tender pen
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Another his betrothed was given;
The imagination to enliven
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
By sympathy I have been driven.
The memory of the bard was driven
Onéguine was a citizen
How deftly could he transport feign!
An exile from their troublous reign,
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
How bitterly he would malign,
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
All bustle when he makes a sign:
Landscapes thereon he would design,
At times talk nonsense with design;
But boldly I myself resign:
My heart's allegiance can resign,
Thine honour is my countersign!
Men opposite. The cross they sign
My gratitude do not disdain,
To crush me with a just disdain.
Listen to me without disdain.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
Should dearly like a dance again.
Shall I behold thee once again?”—
But to the garden once again
The youthful lover once again
Onéguine, bored to death again,
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
Onéguine—take him up again—
That until Christmas comes again
Of love again, and yet again;
A maid hath oft, may yet again
And agitate my heart again;
Or if he meant to flirt again,
It wakens in my breast again.
Tattiana courage doth regain
By an avowal just as plain.
He there is master—that is plain;
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Detest him for a brother slain?
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?”—
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Can lower depths beyond remain?
Would she in silence long remain.
As deaf and silly doth remain,
He obstinately will remain,
But, that life longer may remain,
And gave himself but little pain
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
Me now, inflict upon me pain?—
And an habitual sense of pain;
Spare yourself unavailing pain
"My darling child, thou art in pain.—
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
I know not if his heart felt pain
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
After the wedded couple strain;
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain—”
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
The dream left terror in its train.
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
Or e'en the "Demon” of my strain.
Tania the meaning would obtain
A case of books he doth obtain—
I loved you—what did I obtain?
My light productions to retain,
Although her book did not contain
The household property contain:
His daughter's book to ascertain
Pair after pair the race sustain.
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
And distance interposed in vain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
He reads at random, reads in vain.
And far removed from rumour vain;
I've wasted in amusements vain,
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
The converse of our hermits twain,
To raise a clamour and a din:
In solitude or worldly din,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Ere conversation could begin,
But by degrees the crowd begin
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
With words of foreign origin
The pall of night was growing thin,
At morn an icy bath within
He heard his soul's complaint within,
Still everywhere, without, within,
Where—”—"What! another eclogue spin?
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Pardon I ask for such a sin—
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
In books he saw nought to condemn
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
A canine face with horns thereon,
And that unrivalled paragon,
And gossip of the town and fashion
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The torrent of opinion,
Behold! the world's opinion!
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
The natural fickleness of passion,
The youthful poet's fond confession.
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
My friends, what means this odd digression?
With quite a lachrymose expression
He enters: rapidly discussion
Who without more prevarication
We all of us of education
Onéguine went with trepidation
Tattiana saw with trepidation
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
But Eugene, hating litigation
With inexact pronunciation
And tears of reconciliation:
Tattiana was her appellation.
Although it will not bear translation,
A coquette loves by calculation,
Upon her cheek by adulation
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Not high in general estimation;
Enhances love in estimation
And hot with jealous indignation,
And sulked in silent indignation;
Of such a dread hallucination.
Invigorate imagination
Long time her young imagination
Original imagination,
She did not think "procrastination
Of foreign whims the impersonation—
Triumphant by anticipation,
Their Jealousy and separation
The fair of the next generation,
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
And eye which gleams with inspiration—
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
The idols of their adoration
In pages of a love narration
The hero is of my narration!
The poet's fervid conversation
Introduce verse in conversation.
A charm with it in conversation.
Without constraint in conversation
Not knowing its interpretation,
Alone within his habitation
A Vampire fond of meditation,
An innate love of meditation,
And buried deep in meditation,
As formerly much agitation.
And long internal agitation
And marking Tania's agitation,
A love which knew no limitation,
Which is he? or an imitation,
Thy meditative incantation—
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
Amid a serious disputation,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
To the sarcastic observation,
By what idea or observation
With intellect and strong volition
Meantime Onéguine's apparition
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Quite a sensation; the position
My very latest composition!
And a determined disposition,
For journalistic deglutition
The same unmoved oblivion
Rescue me from oblivion.
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Beneath the silver of the moon
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
And bends her mirror on the moon,
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
'Tis silent—on her shines the moon—
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
"Why did you leave last night so soon?”
Submissive as if in a swoon,
His wife was also mad upon
Our fathers used to dote upon;
Without disgust we look upon?
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
His spirit was intent upon.
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The counsel good and full of reason,
And the cold beauties of the season:
To visit Moscow in the season.
She was thus fond of Richardson
The works of Mr. Richardson.
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Or that adoring Grandison
Was certainly no Grandison.
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?”
Sailed silently in unison—
There an imperious skeleton;
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
To write his forefathers to warn
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Tattiana—thus the sex is born.—
He seemed for matrimony born.
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
A jolly song and distant horn;
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
And sallied forth one brilliant morn—
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
Perchance you also soon may burn,
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
Do we alone our losses mourn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
Delighted glances in return;
Have entered never to return.
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Then to some gallant in your turn
Men will forget me, but my urn
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
To freeze his finger hath begun,
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,”
Across the smiling face of dawn.
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
In silence shall I sit and yawn
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
And on the footstool sitting down
And at the table sat her down.
And the fair sex as light as down!
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
I feel thou wast by God sent down
Approach, approach; I am thine own.”
The aged nurse in ample gown,
In a half-open dressing-gown
You never since your nose have shown.
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
The opportunity is flown.
For summer to the country flown,
Fresh aspirations I have known,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Besides, a duellist well-known
For o'er a word to fashion known,
And bitter torment never known.
What everybody long has known;
He is not there: I am not known:
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
She bows her head beneath the crown;
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
Have one by one all withered grown
Have latterly vexatious grown;
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
"Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown—
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown—
This northern summer of our own,
When will the devil take his own!”
Impelled to union with his own
Far from his Italy—his own.
And the young damsel from the town,
Troy's sages should in concert own
He left you first, and I must own
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
But tell me what am I to do?
Which we experienced long ago.
Familiar to him long ago.
Made me so tipsy long ago!
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
They hand in hand to table go.
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go—
Whither that evening he will go.
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
"Good-bye, Onéguine, I must go.”—
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
But say he was a genius who
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
His daily occupations, lo!
I cannot understand. But lo!
"Is he known to you?”—"Yes and No.”
"And is it she? It must be—no—
Present me.”—"You are joking.”—"No.”—
More troublesome than usual?”—"No!
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Pen, paper bring: the table too
And usually despised it too),
My beauty, thou art ready too.
Yet let us part in friendship, O
But would not look at Cicero.
"To—?”—"Làrina.”—"Tattiana?”—"So.
Inspired him with disgust and so
"Shall we commence?”—"Let it be so,”
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
And so my noon hath come! If so,
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?”—
No more remembered him; unto
For was it not her duty to
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
Together moments one or two
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Or a professor in tulle cap.
The lady in the crimson cap
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
He's a straightforward little chap.”
Or at a promenade mayhap,
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
With iridescent wing doth flap
And all in snow is buried deep.
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
Mountains we'll level and through deep
Buried in meditation deep,
Long time in meditation deep
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
But stares into the darkness deep.
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
The maids beside Tattiana keep—
Her path across the plain doth keep—
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
Where is Onéguine? Half asleep,
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Far from the rest the pair would creep
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
The sun had mounted high his steep,
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Girls in anticipation skip!
With one foot resting on its tip
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
The sudden rattling of a car.
Since in these arms I thee did bear—
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
All are constrained and fetters bear,
To the assembly her they bear.
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
From everything the heart held dear
Come to my golden palace, dear!
I can't conceive a little dear
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Even as the love of children dear.
Of roses to romancers dear;
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
Not only sorrow—Ah! my dear,
And since I pulled thee by the ear—
As in some frenzied dream of fear
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
The path of hope and tender fear—
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
She will not see, she will not hear.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
To be in conversation clear
There is a spot the village near
With sad refrain misfortune near.
And dost thou know her?”—"We live near.”
A friar black approaching near,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Mysteriously all objects near
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
He daily in his drives drew near
Shy, silent did the maid appear
But still more stupid did appear
Do me a favour and appear.
So irremissible appear?
Would at the proper time appear.
Love to inspire doth woe appear
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
Never for me to reappear—
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Unknown to all he doth appear,
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
For which no springtime shall appear?
But as to fighting—'twill appear!
Two dressed in uniform appear—
Doth in us or our names appear
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
The shining orbs of night appear;
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
And happy unto you appear.
More advantageously appear
A vision desolate and drear
In the dawn of existence drear.
The aspect of a landscape drear.
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
All is foreseen. My secret drear
He bending whispered in her ear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Modest yet daring! And a tear
The simple epitaph—a tear
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
For us, may be for many a year.
Long ago?”—"'Tis the second year.”
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
And from the Millionaya afar
And grown more curious by far
Unhappily too salt by far;
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
And that a bottle sealed with tar
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar”
As in the timid forest deer,
And exclamations and good cheer.
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
Gliding in negligent career,
Amid the company career.
"At Làrina's.”—"Hem, that is queer!
To lawless love I should prefer—
"Well!”—"I the elder should prefer,
Girls the kashourka much prefer.
Romance of love I pray refer,
And traces with a slender finger
Tania doth by the casement linger
Adroitly seized and carried her;
And like a shadow haunted her.
"The younger, you're in love with her!”
Doth love's incautiousness in her
Unfavourable unto her.
He leisurely adorns for her.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
To Eve the universal mother,
Recent instructions of its mother.
Gravely repeating to another
Aye bids ye in some way or other—
But finally grew bored by her.
Servant of God and brigadier,
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
Together we have wandered o'er
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Malicious and a slanderer.
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Confront thy fated torturer!
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.—
This was his social character.
What is his latest character?
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”—
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
I'm beaten in another matter;
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
At Russ she was by no means clever
Appear; along the road of Tver
Hope with her fascinating power
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
I tremble lest my humble prayer
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Is occupied with Olga fair,
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Books he abandoned like the fair,
To clank the spur, delight the fair—
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
Describe in detail the affair,
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Pray is it not a tough affair
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
I have dreamed many a vision fair
The gossip of their ladies fair.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
The less we love a lady fair
I uttered to my lady fair
With the epistle of my fair;
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
A kerchief round her silver hair
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
But with confused and bashful air,
And vanish like a bird in air.
Finally tost his arms in air
And the Skatènines, aged pair,
Approaches Olga and the pair
Around the carriage of the pair—
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
He knows Kaverine will repair.
The freshness of her heart impair,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Accents of rapture or despair
Lo! my Onéguine free as air,
Kvass needful was to them as air;
Urging your droshkies swift as air
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Mark ye with what a modest air
Fles past the porter to the stair,
'Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
And Fliànoff, pensioned councillor,
But gray Phillippevna the door
She cannot—Eugene oped the door
She peeped through a chink of the door.
Olga ran skipping from the door.
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Anicia soon appears, the door
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
Comfort and succour to the poor,
Lest the malicious reader or
Is petted by the Emperor?—
Some one or other editor
Opens unto her visitor.
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
And sermon—but in that dread hour
Impressionable for an hour,
I blame not your behaviour—
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Pélagie Nikolavna has
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Onéguine fired—Alas! alas!
In this case quite mistaken was.
Still of his club he member was—
With purple hand Aurora leads,
With tranquil air Onéguine leads
His wife approaches, with him leads
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
That crass stupidity misleads,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
She the delicious novel reads,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
If they but heard domestic loads
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
And all that from thy hand proceeds—
"Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
Already dance to song proceeds;
And rising from her bench proceeds;
And a grand festival proceeds.
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
Professions eagerly for deeds,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
To bring behind: the triple steeds
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Are ye replaced by other maids
Tattiana to a corner, bids
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
His son and mortgages his lands.
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Thus in the earth the seed expands
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
The father scarcely understands
Where each young critic ready stands,
With bated breath, around she bends
At times my reason almost bends,
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
Tattiana from the hill descends
Then glittering in the sun descends.
No one my anguish comprehends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Triumphs—their own or those of friends—
I've had to make for having friends!
Against my inclination, friends,
Existence without wife or friends,
The feet of my dear lady friends.
Their harmless conversation blends
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
His hate by slander, and who spends
And care but little for its ends.
On us beyond the grave attends,
O feet, where'er your path extends
With love which happiness extends;
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And wild among them grew her words—
At least their accents and their words
Of passion reminiscences,
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
My goddesses, where are your shades?
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
The remnant destiny concedes,
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
Tattiana motionless abides.
The unbidden guests he roughly chides—
And supercilious dames she glides,
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
A crab upon a spider rides,
Sits down and gazes on all sides—
Of migratory gipsy hordes—
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
May be that I by heaven's decrees
To understand by slow degrees
The serpent to unlawful trees
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
Not the least trace Onéguine sees
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
And nothing more important sees;
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
And all thy precious elegies,
Around the garden homeward hies.
And overcome antipathies
The shutters open; to the skies
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Where all upon the surface lies,—
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
Look through the window and kill flies.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Tattiana to the index flies
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
When the same life before him lies
What more's required? The world replies,
Ever to hear the same replies
All breathless and without replies.
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
A sportsman who in covert lies.
Had come both friends and enemies—
His friends and also enemies
And the bad book accompanies.
The general who accompanies.
To bear love's parching agonies—
Thrice happy who their agonies
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
She from the winter corn espies
Some a mazurka occupies,
He roars, and "Ah!” Tattiana cries.
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Upon those pages she descries
Even the rosy wafer dries
Past palaces and nunneries,
In the world's mortal revelries,
And pelt him with cherries,
With raspberries, cherries.
To peer into the future tries.
And alphabetically tries
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
My splendid house and gaieties—
From public and from private ties,
Than cold Onéguine's oddities,
At neighbouring hospitalities.
And fashion's gay frivolities;
I yield for splendid vanities,
The gilding of life's vanities,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Spared him not their asperities.
The country hath its liberties
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
The guests make room; aside each takes
He now a full possession takes,
Without grammatical mistakes.
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
His recent glory he invokes.
Also, to equalise the scales,
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
She got a book of nursery tales,
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
But lights incendiary flames
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
To banish far unworthy themes
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
And due precautions take betimes.
Alas! he loved as in our times
I sail upon my lake at times
And the young revellers of past times
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
The fisher's fire afar illumes
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes—
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And an enchanting shoulder shines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
Her head upon her breast declines
Upon her elbow she reclines,
Longer the East inert reclines
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
Wherein love innocently pines.
The golden ember now enshrines,
And fashionable magazines,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
And now he views forgotten foes,
Yes! every one must have his foes,
Now, like hereditary foes,
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
And meditative homeward goes,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
All arise. To the door he goes.
Into the tangled garden goes
All vanished as an echo goes.
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
The accents wild of other's woes,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
He fixedly upon her stares—
The husband comes and interferes
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
Imagination's sacred fires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
As with innumerable fires.
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
Compassion now or wrath inspires
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And where tempestuous love's desires,
And now his youthful heart desires
And of the irksome harness tires,
Jackdaws on every spire—in scores.
Seated, a curious look with glasses
Shouts of applause! Onéguine passes
In true interpretation hates:
And slowly life coagulates—
Which in your spirit dominates,
But wretched who anticipates,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fêtes;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
And what like menaces fatigues,
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
Which shines with iridescent hues.
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
A victim decked with golden leaves;
All which caprice and affluence craves,
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
He enters: to the mill he drives:
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
Beats that of friends and relatives:
Our liberty at least survives:
She the acquaintances she loves,
To the pianoforte he moves
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
And various chords upon it proves,
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
At the same hour she oped her eyes
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
But finally he oped his eyes
Olga he sees before his eyes
Where every day before his eyes
For tallow, wood and other things
His travels like all other things
The peasants there are rich as kings,
But still remembrance to him clings,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
All that industrial London brings
All this in many cases brings
Happy and glorious. But this brings
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Obedient to the magic strings,
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
Slow circling round its fellow swings
The time between the wolf and dogs—
How pleasantly the evening jogs
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
Exceptionless as no rule is,
Calmly her eyes encounter his—
Eugene, more tolerant than this
And deem the world perfection is!
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
I just hint, in parenthesis,
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”—
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
The old man who has had his freaks,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
However, the mazurka lacks
For the first time the hammer clicks.
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
The prince's eye Onéguine seeks:
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
A horse's hoofs she hears—She shrinks!
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
But now—my very blood congeals,
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
May yet be studious of his nails;
And beckon to the passing sails.
Custom the despot soon prevails.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
When the sonorous Bréguet tells
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And the heart's agitated dreams.
For rural solitude and dreams,
And where Thalia softly dreams
To agitate me in my dreams.
Descended swift in turbid streams
And where the admirable streams
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
Their memory lingers still and seems
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
And heedless of approval seems,
Awhile sound conversation seems
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
And more imagination teems.
Glory with which our history teems
Of conversation, thought and aims—
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
The frolics of maidens.
The secrets of maidens.
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
Insensible her hand remains
His kneeling posture he retains—
To secrets of virgins,
Friends and companions,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Old people's simple conversations
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
Latest arrivals' salutations,
They were the wonderful traditions
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
Had finished life amid his sons,
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
With flame more ardent passion burns,
Her heart importunately turns.
But to Onéguine! A propos!
All covered up with snow in heaps,
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
In country towns, where still it keeps
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
A little virgin mirror peeps.
And lonely through the forest creeps.”
I will not wed, and ever weeps
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
The two friends' compliments she hears
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
Without participation hears,
Although the destined coffin nears,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
She calm and unconcerned appears.
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Tattiana in the yard appears
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
All in the good old style appears,
Nearer they come—Eugene appears!
With his ferocious mate appears.
Distracted by her grief appears
And what from its recess appears?
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
And to these letters and these tears.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears—
Likewise an epitaph with tears
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
For visions of my childish years
With Eugene pranks of former years
(So 'twas with us in former years,
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
Onéguine, O my gentle readers,
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But fools—their calumnies and sneers”—
Old age through spectacles too peers,
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
And judgment which unsteady veers
Tattiana certainly infers
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Epicurean philosophers,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Develops and matures its powers,
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
To the theatre he repairs
He to the festival repairs,
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
A moment effervescing stirs,
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
And hated casual visitors,
And the kind-hearted servitors:
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
And where a madrigal occurs
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
Judge then what roses would be ours,
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
The manners of the highest class
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
Both day and night he now must pass
And lo! five paces more they pass,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
Divinity without access
Yet satiated with success,
There was no angling for success.
In the world's vortex my success,
Tattiana in the young princess!
Trembling he seeks the young princess—
But the indifferent princess,
Thus oft—this I myself confess—
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
And now, I mournfully confess,
"If the domestic hearth could bless—
Me your perfections would not bless;
Also their feet—yet ne'ertheless
How flourish, why and wherefore less
With fir-trees standing motionless
Speech was so tame and colourless
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Men become friends from idleness.
To loiter there in idleness
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
Her heart how full of gentleness,
A child devoid of childishness
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
In melancholy loveliness,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
And contemplative dreaminess;
He cannot give me happiness.”
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
"'Twas possible then, happiness—
"But strange am I to happiness;
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Oppressive now is happiness,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And freezing fits of weariness.
All sons of mental weariness.
Their slander e'en was weariness;
In old age life is weariness!”
Amid the awful emptiness
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
In rhyming I show laziness.
Attractive in its banefulness?
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Where my days in the wilderness
Aroused in him some tenderness.
With spiritual tenderness;
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
The bays of age and helplessness.
My lot is fixed—with thoughtlessness
Is it that human restlessness
"Onéguine, all this sumptuousness,
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Await the long-delayed caress.
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Conquer by passion and address,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
To array himself in evening dress.
Meantime in matutinal dress
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
But Eugene long hath left the press
A young Armida's lips to press,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
She starts, nor doth a word express,
To fawn upon and love express;
Wherefore regarding him express
All that the heart would fain express—
I like the difference to express
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Inflict annoyance and distress
Her agitation and distress
Love's tender transports and distress,
And though I read it with distress,
Habit was given us in distress
Nor discontinued to distress
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
A strong resemblance these possess—
Tattiana's letter I possess,
If wife and children to possess
If the raw product they possess
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
Could not in that brief moment guess!
The uncontaminated kiss
Have felt love's agitated kiss
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,—
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
Even amusing fools we miss
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Can count the time without much fuss—
Beside the thundering abyss
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
As every journal now entreats,
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
And stay whose length none recollects.
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Leaning against the dam expects,
Their coming which no man expects,
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Whom latterly one often meets
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
Though without palaces and streets,
Past darkened windows and long streets
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
And oh! what verses, what delights,
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
And his poor basten sandal knits.
As formerly the shepherd sits
The maiden at her casement sits
With cherries, red currants,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
But, after mutual compliments,
The epistle from the bard presents.
She visited the humble tents
The hours once more Onéguine counts,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
Ever receive with kindly hearts
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
We Russians, friends from distant parts
The Paris of those country parts
Deliberate approach of guests
Variety of speech and vests,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
And like Napoleons each of us
The stomach doth admonish us.
A million bipeds reckons thus
Corneille's majestic genius,
Whereto in language courteous
Yea! although rendered beauteous
A critic of the stage malicious,
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
A slave of actresses capricious,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
The conversation tedious
Oh! who is not calumnious?
There Didelot became glorious,
She seemed of him oblivious,
By such allusions scandalous,
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
With satisfaction marvellous,
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
How mean, how pusillanimous!
Amid sly, pusillanimous
The drive becomes monotonous—
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Thou also, reader generous,
Then ye were barely generous,
It was a cheery, generous
He shunned those parties boisterous;
Abandon cities riotous,
Well! Làrina appears to us
Come sing we in chorus
Who labours hard to humour us?
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
The friend of liberty and laws
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
His watch, the sun in turn he views—
Perverse, unfavourable views?
And through the lofty windows views
To male acquaintances he bows,
The men salute with lower bows
The epitaph on marble shows:
With all dissatisfaction shows.
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
When Passion's fire no longer glows
Before a fire which feebly glows
And this the faithful one allows,
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
For otherwise—God only knows!
The first appearance of the snows
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Upon the dreary northern snows,
Through dense aristocratic rows
On unknown female forms he throws.
The connoisseur his glances throws
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows—
And I confess that now-a-days
But even thus not now-a-days!
Of fiery youth's untutored days
To vary for a few brief days.
Alas! the friend of childish days
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
We called to mind our youthful days—
That vanished are my youthful days
As the sins of my youthful days
As partner of my mournful days,
And then to meditate for days
The very morning of our days.
Companion of my childhood's days.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
In one of thine enchanting lays
Consisting of harmonious lays,
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
No more with pale Diana's rays,
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Alas! my stomach it betrays
When he in ardent verse portrays
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Onéguine his excuses says;
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Or parody of modern ways?
But soon she altered all her ways,
Delighted much his former ways
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
And hates the world's discordant ways.
Unto Anicia for the keys
The household troop of little boys,
A joyous troop of little boys
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Who cannot conjure former joys?
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Ere this but one brief moment beat
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Age immature averse to cheat—
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
And in a whisper did repeat:
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
I mean my name not to repeat.”
I might to connoisseurs repeat
Which lessons unto us repeat,
A hundred times will not repeat,
Now all things round about repeat
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
And at economy was great;
Alone amid possessions great,
And cry: he was a poet great!
On this artistical retreat
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
When in the study's calm retreat,
A ball here, there a children's treat,
Till out of breath upon a seat
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Abandoned he his country seat,
Removed her to his country seat,
Approach not to gaze at
Begins to talk of this and that,
"No misery I see in that”—
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
Upon my lake I love to float,
But when two minutes she had sat,
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
Her brow she did not e'en contract
And blush to own himself reflect.
Of keen sarcastic intellect
With so much warmth and intellect?
Two verses he could recollect
Where I can no more recollect?—
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
So prudent, and so circumspect
The glass unwittingly inspect
Such am I. This did ye expect,
And Christian folk will, I expect,
An inn at every stage erect.
The disenchanted glass direct
Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
So full of piety, correct,
Herein my portrait should detect,
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet—
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Are oft deceptive—like their feet.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
But now—what brings you to my feet?—
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
And rapid whirl of many feet,
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
The miserable bard to meet,
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
Where fashionable circles meet
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Her with a smile old women greet,
Near Khariton's in a side street
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
That heart with inspiration sweet
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
The words and looks of charmers sweet
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”
Wherein I castigation get;
But time flies and she doth forget
Ah! I still struggle to forget
Beside a nameless rivulet,
And by that shady rivulet
Without enthusiasm he met
When in her walks abroad she met
Where God alone knows whom she met.
The hour when—Fate so willed—we met
Of one thing till again we met.
Then in the silent cabinet
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
My friends, the poet ye regret!
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Ere the bright messenger had set.
It will be by a mob beset
And we—an unattractive set—
A simple tombstone hath been set.
On whom a sister's heart was set
Of every sort and every set!”—
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
For twice you came to them and yet
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Where in the country Eugene yet,
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Onéguine, hast forgotten yet
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
"Then amongst strangers I was left—
Of consolation all bereft—
Who secretly denounced the gift,
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
And by the world repeated oft,
Born of a babbler in a loft
Raises within my breast as oft
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
But from the Muses' loftiest height
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
And hurried home his awful freight.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Above the yawning grave would fight,—
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
"I with my friend intend to fight!”
Our hero stops and doth alight,
All about Olga—to a light
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
The crowd and merriment and light,
In my young days of wild delight
E'en for an instant find delight,
"But death from him will be delight.
The curse of commonplace delight.
His spirit sank with strange delight.
Abandoning insane delight,
Who in thy love finds more delight
To find in gossip such delight,
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
In such an album with delight
They will receive us with delight.”
A sense of social delight,
And with emotional delight
He finally lost all delight
And bless mankind with full delight.
His ardent soul with full delight.
And solitude and calm delight,
And solitude and calm delight.
The votary of vain delight
Contemplativeness, her delight,
And like the prisoner's our delight
My pen no longer finds delight,
I love its furious delight,
And full of innocent delight,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
Blest be the labours of the light,
As a babe's slumber, or the light
Or but for fame he saw the light;
And Schiller read by candlelight.
Bu, ere he mounts the marble flight,
An ever transcendental flight;
There came a sudden flash of light,
Aurora's ruddy rays of light—
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
Was withered ere the morning light—
And showed with an uncertain light
His care unto his pistols' plight,
By liberties or loose or light.
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
Arising with the morning's light,
That the two friends with morning's light
But lo! already the moon's light
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
The firmament in mellow light,
Was younger than myself, my light,
Yet clearer shines than every light
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The china teapot too ye might
If in the scenes of home I might
And be as happy—as I might.
Time was, a valiant general might
Resounding through all ages might
Lay languishing both day and night—
Terror of guardians of the night;
And blest the shadows of the night.
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
Outside descend the mists of night.
From her half-open vest of night.
The moon, the stars, and shining night—
Full many a lovely star hath night
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
And glasses unemployed all night;
The altar flame was quenched in night.
So there will be a dance to-night.
But turning morning into night,
How oft, when on a summer night
My morning birdie, yesternight
That glimmered through the radiant night
"Delighted.”—"When?”—"This very night.
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
And better, if I judge aright;
All this, my friends, translate aright:
Seductive, animated, bright,
His ditties were as pure and bright
And is it true her garland bright
The motley moving mass and bright,
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
When I yon semicircle bright
The goblet still is bubbling bright—
Behold! the moon was shining bright
Adorned with many a vision bright
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
In winter on the fender bright,
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
And form a network left and right;
I was half silly with affright.
And never was the ear affright
Other and colder thoughts affright,
In the first place, say, am I right?
Paris and Menelaus right.
Before whose inexperienced sight
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
As yet none had discovered aught;
I am not worthy them in aught;
If they were similar in aught.
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
Its passions and its modes of thought.
As on the rapid wings of thought
Because in singleness of thought
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Of harmony enshrining thought.
Full of exasperating thought.
A register of fleeting thought,
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Immersed in melancholy thought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Eugene of course related nought,
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
She hears of conversation nought
The languid mind could smile at nought,
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
And my dark soul to light was brought;
A table to the fire is brought,
But trusted the ideal she wrought?—
At first such contradictions wrought
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
My memory wandered wide and sought
Again her rural life she sought,
The early days of life we sought.
From storms protection having sought,
Though by an error and unsought—
The "in memoriam” pages sought,
With measured step and even gait
All Nature winter seemed to await,
On guests their servants used to wait
But now ridiculous a bit.
Must take a walk and rest a bit—
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Though we will not acknowledge it.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
On winters of the south a skit,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
The table with its lamp unlit,
Onéguine could not now submit,
He somewhat blushing would omit:
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
This he believed: a kindred spirit
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
The master always used to sit.
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit—
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The snow upon the streets doth melt—
Whither along them doth he pelt?
E'en as the poet says he leant.
A letter for her hero meant:
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
As we lure the young gallant,
Allure the young gallant
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
On fresh allurements they are bent,
And o'er the granite coping bent,
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
His butting horns in anger bent,
In the unmoved, magnificent
Like a full moon magnificent.
Now talkative, now reticent;
Who would the maiden innocent
Of affectation innocent,
Because she was so innocent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Haughty appear, subservient,
That Heaven her character had blent
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Or torturer malevolent?
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Bringing his partner corpulent
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Shines in the female firmament
With scandal's trivial ornament.
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
A timid love to banishment?—
To what malicious merriment,
Awakens secret merriment
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
The limits of enlightenment
Calm and without embarrassment,
Having this mournful document
But now—none heeds the monument
With epigrams impertinent,
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Wherein a space Onéguine spent.
Since leisure was together spent,
A while ago the winter spent,
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Obsequious or indifferent!
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Now it is ready to be sent—
"You have a letter to me sent.
Their heroes used to represent
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Being from hell or heaven sent,
To a surrender gave consent,
No answer! He another sent.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
And with his lot in life content,
But was our friend Eugene content,
First reconciled and then content;
And scanned in silence its content.
So Tania to her heart's content
In course of time (the whole extent
Time was, in style magniloquent
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
Into the lonely house she went,
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
'Tis time she to the altar went!
Not so! My Moscow never went
And all the three to breakfast went;
Onéguine to the window went
The Làrinas unwisely went,
The poor girl fell into a faint,
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
An invalid from lung complaint.
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Long since I held thee at the font—
A forest now she sees in front
In spite of common sense we're wont
And I to give thee cakes was wont?”—
And in the final tome we learnt,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
Ourselves as unities to count;
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
And consolation soon begot.
To labour in his sledge forgot,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
Then, the far capital forgot,
What once I knew is clean forgot—
Onéguine lightning glances shot;
Philanthropist or patriot,
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
Inseparable from our lot;
My country and an exile's lot;
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
To Russ indigenous are not;
Just at this moment I cannot.
One moment's slumber suffer not.
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Into the district then to boot
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Examine her from head to foot.
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
And meditative from the spot
Was a delightful little spot,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
Just manages a feeble trot
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
Into the chamber where he slept
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Thee but a little space bewept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Because her passion wanted art,
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Rekindled in my withered heart
But the young unpolluted heart
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
And ease the tortures of the heart—
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
A maiden's secrets—of the heart.
Obeyed the impulses of heart?—
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
Confessions which a trusting heart
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
The indignation of her heart!
And the lone secret of her heart,
A lancer captivates her heart!
Method was dear unto his heart
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
Within her; she is sick at heart;
Wherein I buried left my heart.
But followed the strict rules of art,
The fires of passion and its smart—
But Fortune cast our lots apart
Then touching Olga they depart
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
A hidden meaning could impart,
And oft in whispers would impart
May well in innocence impart.
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Their voices nought to her impart
Poetic transport. They impart
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
How well he played the greenhorn's part
How soon he learnt deception's art,
By flattery and lover's art—
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Anew the flames of passion start
Eugene designed with me to start
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
His own antagonists expert,
And, by the way, I here assert
As oft to meat and drink advert,
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
To accompany him and to escort
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
An infant maiden doth exhort
And no ridiculous report,
A box of terrible import.
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
When the obedient doll in sport
Like a Bacchante in her sport
At times to silence would resort,
With pungent or obtuse retort,
There is no fishmarket retort
Vociferously paid her court,
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
As if it were some funeral feast.
That youthful heart—"But, now at least,
He was beloved: or say at least,
Ah! I'm so weak—my throbbing breast!
Had not yet withered his young breast.
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!”
Bard of the "Feasts,” and mournful breast,
For every loyal Russian breast!
She hid the trouble of her breast,
She buries deep within her breast
"I weep. And if within your breast
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
'Twas she who first within his breast
And about dawn upon his breast
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
I by the button-hole seize fast
Poetical enthusiast,
Which might for many ages last.
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
The fatal hour had come at last—
She found herself alone at last,
Vanished his youthful years at last,
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
A flimsy trace of musings past
The laws of generations past,
From shades of the relentless past.
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The gulf between them was so vast,
But this is my advice, 'twere best
In Russ her love made manifest,
Is once again made manifest.
A new world was made manifest!
No sense was ever manifest
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
To treat the matter as a jest,
And is it true and not a jest,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest—
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
The credulous indeed are blest,
Just so! that modest swain is blest
A life in common with the rest;
Like you and me and all the rest?—
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Let us go seek a little rest—
Ye feel but little interest,
Now with what eager interest
Having once fixed your interest,
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
The body they consigned to rest,
And grant his weary bones their rest
His weary head declined at rest,
A beauty languidly at rest,
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
By fond illusions once possest
(This joking I used to protest),
And then made merry pope and guest,
But first permission did request
With this immoderate request
Their idols they were wont to invest
With what avidity and zest
Devoured them with an eager zest.
And so—God bless them, if He list.
Am I to go through the whole list?”
Unto the sounding sea to list,
She led me through nocturnal mist
Their own productions, some insist
So many neighbours here exist—
They may forget that we exist.
No greater pleasure can exist
From apprehension of the cost,
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
That every morn at Verrey's cost
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
When in as instant she is lost,—
By their own horses, not the post—
Romances pleased her from the first,
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
To light had brought them from their dust,
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
Who words and actions will adjust
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
All the young people round about,
See, I can hardly crawl about—
But you must both be quite tired out!
Can we not stealthily make out
At forty suffered from the gout,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Within resounded shriek and shout:
Their claims and explanations shout.
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Lenski his pencil-case took out
A little Juvenal to spout,
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
Of creditors a hungry rout
His comedies, a noisy rout,
"My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
The wind rose instantly, blew out
On lines invisible are fixt;
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
To the young girl he said adieu,
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The God of Love is after you!
Demands that I translate for you
But with austerity!—for you
"But, mátushka, to Moscow you

And now upon the snow in thaw
The time when Melancholy's claw
Obedient then to Nature's law,
He offers her his murderous paw;
I have known beauties cold and raw
A young man motionless he saw,
When in that company she saw
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
He in imagination saw
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
The woods, still naked to the view,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Russia's Terpsichore review
I still a complication view,
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
She never more his face may view,
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Had reconciled the pair anew!
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
(Though certainly mankind he knew
But upon all that Eugene knew
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
My little book. With thee I knew
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
The triumph of a conquest new.
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
As in a garden when I grew,
And by degrees upon him grew
And soon imagination threw
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
To look on life as on a show,
Villages in the distance show
What languor would his silence show,
To-morrow Tania we will show,
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Unto a carping world must show—
Nearest and dearest knew not how
He back as from a sudden blow?—
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
They are all natural and low,
A feeble version read below,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
Gazing upon a note below.
All the creations which below
To end with him her path below.
Which falls in starry flakes below.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
With its exhilarating flow,
From happy inspiration flow,
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
Where plentifully feelings flow
They sat, but conversation's flow
How full of fire his speech would glow!
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whose countless golden crosses glow
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
To the youth Eugene hurried now—
Society he duped enow.”
The unaffected traits she now
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
Then they came easily enow,
Its insignificance I know
No obstacle of which I know.
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
And in the morning doth not know
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
"Tania, my eldest child, you know”—
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
And where may be her sister now?
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Her handkerchief she loses now;
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Till January fell no snow—
But such is not my project now,
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Nought but of dinners a long row,
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
And all your love on self bestow;
And linen on him doth bestow.
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The bee forth from his cell of wax
We glide along a floor of wax.
In this the love of the fair sex
In love, although its tempests vex,
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And also fashionable beaux.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
And past the threshold of decay,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
What, invitations? The same day
Beside the stormy sea one day
Unto their solitude one day,
And in reality one day
Impatient waits the close of day,
To anticipate the break of day,
To-morrow before break of day,
Listless is she the livelong day
He sat, and then the livelong day,
In cruel solitude each day
In haunts of fashion where each day
Jilted—glad of a holiday.
Spectacles upon nose, all day
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
Yet on a frosty winter day
To-morrow just like yesterday.
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Well! just as she was yesterday.
From Romulus unto our day.
We visit about Christmas Day,
She gazed around her—it was day.
And wholly occupied his day—
Olga's admirer came that day:
Had much to do at home that day,
As men who much had done that day.
That he was "ready any day.”
She was as heedless and as gay—
Time was, his raillery was gay,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Till morn—life uniform but gay,
And for a time our course delay,
Arrange without the least delay—
The bridegroom sage without delay
"Bring dinner now without delay!”
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
No senseless fashionable lay
How sick to death his uncle lay
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Within his memory there lay,
"How often in thine arms I lay;
Then, her distraction to allay,
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
How with thy medal I would play,
The military band will play.
A game of chess would often play,
Was wont with me at cards to play.
Cunning already to display
'Tis there that arrant fops display
For the young poet they display.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
To make wise men the idiot play
He would not that a man ye slay
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
In the beginning of this lay,
Unto the hero of this lay
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay—
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Was drawn, ideal of my lay—
But the dark sepulchre I may
Some army poet therein may
That grandmothers and grandsires may
And though perchance a lady may
Or by a card our homage pay,
Another visit hastes to pay.
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
Let us congratulations pay
To see his Olga ere the fray—
Curtly announcing for the fray
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?”—
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Here bottles stand in close array,
His intellect in close array.
Behind, of glasses an array,
But I abandoned their array,
The trees in silvery array,
A cup of tea upon a tray.
And well-instructed to betray!
All with urbanity betray,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Minutely I will now portray.
Tattiana purchased with a stray
So frequently his mind would stray
Thither hussars on leave will stray
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
And thus unto her nurse did say:
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
And starting suddenly doth say:
Almost became a poet say—
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
Transfixed Onéguine mine doth stay.
He cared no longer there to stay,
Horror! had she not better stay
But it grew late; he must not stay;
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
Nor did her blushes fade away,
The starry beacons fade away,
Carried a truth divine away;
Onéguine Olga bore away.
How oft the kindly Muse away
And gallops to her house away.
As it were, tore himself away.
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
From the dread pistol turn away.
Without a chance to slip away.
The mystic lines to tear away
Deep in the greenwood far away?
And to Onéguine far away
But thoughts meander far away—
Lost in the hamlet far away.
But borne in spirit far away
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
But Summer swiftly fades away
I write, and anguish flies away,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
It whiled his idle hours away
The lily's stem to eat away,
Unto her husband, went away—
With serious air then went away
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
Take to their wings and fly away.
There jars of cider block the way,
His furs are powdered on the way
In a lax or informal way,
He still made love in a queer way;
Unto the fields she makes her way,
Ah! he has gone the other way”—
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Impetuously clove its way
Ivan Petròvitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
Onéguine sat the table by
But I was sharp in times gone by.
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
No trace ye left in passing by
At table she was sitting by
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And like a palisade flit by.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Tania, observed by nobody,
And (elbows on the table) they
To consanguineous dinners they
More crimson every moment they.
To idle musing was a prey;
A lover's letter might convey,
Eventually petrify
May find a crumb to satisfy.
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
Possess my love and sympathy.
The witching light of sympathy;
At least by show of sympathy;
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
I cannot tell the reason why,
She fears she cannot.—Cannot? Why?—
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The nights of golden Italy
Presents her quarto amiably,
But Eugene, incontestably,
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
Upon his couch insensibly;
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
At morn I must assuredly
And now we hear delightedly
What agitation languidly
But not at present, though sincerely
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
And turned to leave immediately,
"No matter, look immediately.
Took aim—but as immediately
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
Or innocently past me fly.
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
The evanescent fashions fly
Unto the gates the servants fly
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
I like this word exceedingly
And the world met her smilingly,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
Harvests of souls unceasingly
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
"Who will be there?”—"The family.
What say you? to the family—
And like Childe Harold gloomily
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
And the far mountains daintily
Terror assails her. Hastily
So from the mountain lazily
I would not part with finally;
God save his soul eternally
With him were friends eternally:
But of this love, e'en casually,
To all she answers cruelly—
By waters shining tranquilly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Descried before me suddenly!
Have my Onéguine—suddenly.
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
His transports were quite maidenly,
"What! Grandison?”—"Yes, certainly!”
The reaping girls approach and ply
Prevailed at last. She in reply
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
Though I'll return to him right early,
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
From habit or maliciously,
Like Venus when, capriciously,
Or into bold hands anxiously
You'll spend your winter famously!
In the French language perfectly,
Known unto children perfectly:
"Then send your grandson quietly
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Then he'd malign them secretly
To lay two covers secretly.
Turned to her and discordantly
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Oh! I accept. And instantly
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
The same warm vision constantly;
Employ your glasses constantly,
She cannot—then impatiently
He drops his pistol silently.
With clouded brow stands silently?
Around her neck, now violently
"And he—but of him presently—
And of the attic. Honestly,
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
Having performed his service truly,
The artifice of villany—
He brought from mystic Germany
The captain of a company.
But who in that choice company
There, in that knot of company,
Wallow, my friends, in company!
The man and liked his company,
I thank thee. In thy company,
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Then be it so! My destiny
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
There is no stupid calumny
She loved upon the balcony
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
It occupied him from a boy,
Into the study of the boy
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
Which in the winter were a joy:
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
In idleness and tranquil joy
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
The happiest days of life employ?
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
The feeble moment would espy
And following them ye might espy
Must now my stanzas occupy.
But more the passions occupy
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Light sallies without coxcombry,
She strains her throat to force a cry—
Dark shadows thicken—a dread cry
And wakened him with the loud cry:
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
Upon the windows tracery,
By night prepared for sorcery,
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
And turned aside the drapery;
The clue unto some mystery
To be a charming mystery:
With ardent sighs and flattery
Alike by sighs and flattery.
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
Sed alia tempora. And bravery
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
But, her own room in memory,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
Relate some ancient history.”
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
Free, I renewed the idolatry
That Nina's marble symmetry,
Fragments of northern poetry,
And platitudes and pedantry,
He feared the criminal might try
Will pass; the same to-morrow try—
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
Byron's capricious phantasy
Carried away by ecstasy,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Must bow in common courtesy;
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
By the sick lady's gaiety
Lead into good society,
Lest jaded with satiety,
With jealous fear, anxiety.
But man of sense and probity.
Upon its damp opacity,
This, this were true felicity!
Before such fond simplicity
Charming with grave simplicity.
And mental elasticity.
Of Russian domesticity;
Yet with a feigned frigidity
Cursing his own stupidity,
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
Discovered much absurdity,
By dull insensibility,
And then with blind credulity
And husbands' tedious amity?
But grant with magnanimity
And naked uniformity.
The blessings of humanity.
Like him renouncing vanity,
By his embarrassed dignity—
Of old maids the divinity,
I will with thy divinity
Passed into dull eternity,
Have echoed to eternity.
Hears not my importunity!
As giddy youth's hilarity—
Charming is your sincerity,
As Winter in their purity,
Dreams with no continuity,
The style of wise antiquity.
It carries of antiquity
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
With hope and then perplexity,
With us 'tis quite a novelty
Also my wretched liberty
The child of sloth and liberty.
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
Idolatry of liberty,
I thought—retirement, liberty,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Of tender years the modesty
﻿"My uncle's goodness is extreme,
If seriously he hath disease;
He hath acquired the world's esteem
And nothing more important sees;
A paragon of virtue he!
But what a nuisance it will be,
Chained to his bedside night and day
Without a chance to slip away.
Ye need dissimulation base
A dying man with art to soothe,
Beneath his head the pillow smooth,
And physic bring with mournful face,
To sigh and meditate alone:
When will the devil take his own!”
Thus mused a madcap young, who drove
Through clouds of dust at postal pace,
By the decree of Mighty Jove,
Inheritor of all his race.
Friends of Liudmila and Ruslan,
Let me present ye to the man,
Who without more prevarication
The hero is of my narration!
Onéguine, O my gentle readers,
Was born beside the Neva, where
It may be ye were born, or there
Have shone as one of fashion's leaders.
I also wandered there of old,
But cannot stand the northern cold.
Having performed his service truly,
Deep into debt his father ran;
Three balls a year he gave ye duly,
At last became a ruined man.
But Eugene was by fate preserved,
For first "madame” his wants observed,
And then "monsieur” supplied her place;
The boy was wild but full of grace.
"Monsieur l'Abbé” a starving Gaul,
Fearing his pupil to annoy,
Instructed jestingly the boy,
Morality taught scarce at all;
Gently for pranks he would reprove
And in the Summer Garden rove.
When youth's rebellious hour drew near
And my Eugene the path must trace—
The path of hope and tender fear—
Monsieur clean out of doors they chase.
Lo! my Onéguine free as air,
Cropped in the latest style his hair,
Dressed like a London dandy he
The giddy world at last shall see.
He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
In the French language perfectly,
Danced the mazurka gracefully,
Without the least constraint he bowed.
What more's required? The world replies,
He is a charming youth and wise.
We all of us of education
A something somehow have obtained,
Thus, praised be God! a reputation
With us is easily attained.
Onéguine was—so many deemed
[Unerring critics self-esteemed],
Pedantic although scholar like,
In truth he had the happy trick
Without constraint in conversation
Of touching lightly every theme.
Silent, oracular ye'd see him
Amid a serious disputation,
Then suddenly discharge a joke
The ladies' laughter to provoke.
Latin is just now not in vogue,
But if the truth I must relate,
Onéguine knew enough, the rogue
A mild quotation to translate,
A little Juvenal to spout,
With "vale” finish off a note;
Two verses he could recollect
Of the Æneid, but incorrect.
In history he took no pleasure,
The dusty chronicles of earth
For him were but of little worth,
Yet still of anecdotes a treasure
Within his memory there lay,
From Romulus unto our day.
For empty sound the rascal swore he
Existence would not make a curse,
Knew not an iamb from a choree,
Although we read him heaps of verse.
Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
But Adam Smith to read appeared,
And at economy was great;
That is, he could elucidate
How empires store of wealth unfold,
How flourish, why and wherefore less
If the raw product they possess
The medium is required of gold.
The father scarcely understands
His son and mortgages his lands.
But upon all that Eugene knew
I have no leisure here to dwell,
But say he was a genius who
In one thing really did excel.
It occupied him from a boy,
A labour, torment, yet a joy,
It whiled his idle hours away
And wholly occupied his day—
The amatory science warm,
Which Ovid once immortalized,
For which the poet agonized
Laid down his life of sun and storm
On the steppes of Moldavia lone,
Far from his Italy—his own.
How soon he learnt deception's art,
Hope to conceal and jealousy,
False confidence or doubt to impart,
Sombre or glad in turn to be,
Haughty appear, subservient,
Obsequious or indifferent!
What languor would his silence show,
How full of fire his speech would glow!
How artless was the note which spoke
Of love again, and yet again;
How deftly could he transport feign!
How bright and tender was his look,
Modest yet daring! And a tear
Would at the proper time appear.
How well he played the greenhorn's part
To cheat the inexperienced fair,
Sometimes by pleasing flattery's art,
Sometimes by ready-made despair;
Of tender years the modesty
The feeble moment would espy
Conquer by passion and address,
Await the long-delayed caress.
Avowal then 'twas time to pray,
Attentive to the heart's first beating,
Follow up love—a secret meeting
Arrange without the least delay—
Then, then—well, in some solitude
Lessons to give he understood!
How soon he learnt to titillate
The heart of the inveterate flirt!
Desirous to annihilate
His own antagonists expert,
How bitterly he would malign,
With many a snare their pathway line!
But ye, O happy husbands, ye
With him were friends eternally:
The crafty spouse caressed him, who
By Faublas in his youth was schooled,
And the suspicious veteran old,
The pompous, swaggering cuckold too,
Who floats contentedly through life,
Proud of his dinners and his wife!
One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
His valet brings him letters three.
What, invitations? The same day
As many entertainments be!
A ball here, there a children's treat,
Whither shall my rapscallion flit?
Whither shall he go first? He'll see,
Perchance he will to all the three.
Meantime in matutinal dress
And hat surnamed a "Bolivar”
He hies unto the "Boulevard,”
To loiter there in idleness
Until the sleepless Bréguet chime
Announcing to him dinner-time.
'Tis dark. He seats him in a sleigh,
"Drive on!” the cheerful cry goes forth,
His furs are powdered on the way
By the fine silver of the north.
He bends his course to Talon's, where
He knows Kaverine will repair.
He enters. High the cork arose
And Comet champagne foaming flows.
Before him red roast beef is seen
And truffles, dear to youthful eyes,
Flanked by immortal Strasbourg pies,
The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
And Limburg cheese alive and old
Is seen next pine-apples of gold.
Still thirst fresh draughts of wine compels
To cool the cutlets' seething grease,
When the sonorous Bréguet tells
Of the commencement of the piece.
A critic of the stage malicious,
A slave of actresses capricious,
Onéguine was a citizen
Of the domains of the side-scene.
To the theatre he repairs
Where each young critic ready stands,
Capers applauds with clap of hands,
With hisses Cleopatra scares,
Moina recalls for this alone
That all may hear his voice's tone.
Thou fairy-land! Where formerly
Shone pungent Satire's dauntless king,
Von Wisine, friend of liberty,
And Kniajnine, apt at copying.
The young Simeonova too there
With Ozeroff was wont to share
Applause, the people's donative.
There our Katènine did revive
Corneille's majestic genius,
Sarcastic Shakhovskoi brought out
His comedies, a noisy rout,
There Didelot became glorious,
There, there, beneath the side-scene's shade
The drama of my youth was played.
My goddesses, where are your shades?
Do ye not hear my mournful sighs?
Are ye replaced by other maids
Who cannot conjure former joys?
Shall I your chorus hear anew,
Russia's Terpsichore review
Again in her ethereal dance?
Or will my melancholy glance
On the dull stage find all things changed,
The disenchanted glass direct
Where I can no more recollect?—
A careless looker-on estranged
In silence shall I sit and yawn
And dream of life's delightful dawn?
The house is crammed. A thousand lamps
On pit, stalls, boxes, brightly blaze,
Impatiently the gallery stamps,
The curtain now they slowly raise.
Obedient to the magic strings,
Brilliant, ethereal, there springs
Forth from the crowd of nymphs surrounding
Istomina the nimbly-bounding;
With one foot resting on its tip
Slow circling round its fellow swings
And now she skips and now she spring
Now her lithe form she arches o'er
And beats with rapid foot the floor.
Shouts of applause! Onéguine passes
Between the stalls, along the toes;
Seated, a curious look with glasses
On unknown female forms he throws.
Free scope he yields unto his glance,
Reviews both dress and countenance,
With all dissatisfaction shows.
To male acquaintances he bows,
And finally he deigns let fall
Upon the stage his weary glance.
He yawns, averts his countenance,
Exclaiming, "We must change 'em all!
I long by ballets have been bored,
Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
Snakes, satyrs, loves with many a shout
Across the stage still madly sweep,
Whilst the tired serving-men without
Wrapped in their sheepskins soundly sleep.
Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
Still everywhere, without, within,
The lamps illuminating shine;
The steed benumbed still pawing stands
And of the irksome harness tires,
And still the coachmen round the fires
Abuse their masters, rub their hands:
But Eugene long hath left the press
To array himself in evening dress.
Faithfully shall I now depict,
Portray the solitary den
Wherein the child of fashion strict
Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
All that industrial London brings
For tallow, wood and other things
Across the Baltic's salt sea waves,
All which caprice and affluence craves,
All which in Paris eager taste,
Choosing a profitable trade,
For our amusement ever made
And ease and fashionable waste,—
Adorned the apartment of Eugene,
Philosopher just turned eighteen.
China and bronze the tables weight,
Amber on pipes from Stamboul glows,
And, joy of souls effeminate,
Phials of crystal scents enclose.
Combs of all sizes, files of steel,
Scissors both straight and curved as well,
Of thirty different sorts, lo! brushes
Both for the nails and for the tushes.
Rousseau, I would remark in passing,
Could not conceive how serious Grimm
Dared calmly cleanse his nails 'fore him,
Eloquent raver all-surpassing,—
The friend of liberty and laws
In this case quite mistaken was.
The most industrious man alive
May yet be studious of his nails;
What boots it with the age to strive?
Custom the despot soon prevails.
A new Kaverine Eugene mine,
Dreading the world's remarks malign,
Was that which we are wont to call
A fop, in dress pedantical.
Three mortal hours per diem he
Would loiter by the looking-glass,
And from his dressing-room would pass
Like Venus when, capriciously,
The goddess would a masquerade
Attend in male attire arrayed.
On this artistical retreat
Having once fixed your interest,
I might to connoisseurs repeat
The style in which my hero dressed;
Though I confess I hardly dare
Describe in detail the affair,
Since words like pantaloons, vest, coat,
To Russ indigenous are not;
And also that my feeble verse—
Pardon I ask for such a sin—
With words of foreign origin
Too much I'm given to intersperse,
Though to the Academy I come
And oft its Dictionary thumb.
But such is not my project now,
So let us to the ball-room haste,
Whither at headlong speed doth go
Eugene in hackney carriage placed.
Past darkened windows and long streets
Of slumbering citizens he fleets,
Till carriage lamps, a double row,
Cast a gay lustre on the snow,
Which shines with iridescent hues.
He nears a spacious mansion's gate,
By many a lamp illuminate,
And through the lofty windows views
Profiles of lovely dames he knows
And also fashionable beaux.
Our hero stops and doth alight,
Fles past the porter to the stair,
Bu, ere he mounts the marble flight,
With hurried hand smooths down his hair.
He enters: in the hall a crowd,
No more the music thunders loud,
Some a mazurka occupies,
Crushing and a confusing noise;
Spurs of the Cavalier Guard clash,
The feet of graceful ladies fly,
And following them ye might espy
Full many a glance like lightning flash,
And by the fiddle's rushing sound
The voice of jealousy is drowned.
In my young days of wild delight
On balls I madly used to dote,
Fond declarations they invite
Or the delivery of a note.
So hearken, every worthy spouse,
I would your vigilance arouse,
Attentive be unto my rhymes
And due precautions take betimes.
Ye mothers also, caution use,
Upon your daughters keep an eye,
Employ your glasses constantly,
For otherwise—God only knows!
I lift a warning voice because
I long have ceased to offend the laws.
Alas! life's hours which swiftly fly
I've wasted in amusements vain,
But were it not immoral I
Should dearly like a dance again.
I love its furious delight,
The crowd and merriment and light,
The ladies, their fantastic dress,
Also their feet—yet ne'ertheless
Scarcely in Russia can ye find
Three pairs of handsome female feet;
Ah! I still struggle to forget
A pair; though desolate my mind,
Their memory lingers still and seems
To agitate me in my dreams.
When, where, and in what desert land,
Madman, wilt thou from memory raze
Those feet? Alas! on what far strand
Do ye of spring the blossoms graze?
Lapped in your Eastern luxury,
No trace ye left in passing by
Upon the dreary northern snows,
But better loved the soft repose
Of splendid carpets richly wrought.
I once forgot for your sweet cause
The thirst for fame and man's applause,
My country and an exile's lot;
My joy in youth was fleeting e'en
As your light footprints on the green.
Diana's bosom, Flora's cheeks,
Are admirable, my dear friend,
But yet Terpsichore bespeaks
Charms more enduring in the end.
For promises her feet reveal
Of untold gain she must conceal,
Their privileged allurements fire
A hidden train of wild desire.
I love them, O my dear Elvine,
Beneath the table-cloth of white,
In winter on the fender bright,
In springtime on the meadows green,
Upon the ball-room's glassy floor
Or by the ocean's rocky shore.
Beside the stormy sea one day
I envied sore the billows tall,
Which rushed in eager dense array
Enamoured at her feet to fall.
How like the billow I desired
To kiss the feet which I admired!
No, never in the early blaze
Of fiery youth's untutored days
So ardently did I desire
A young Armida's lips to press,
Her cheek of rosy loveliness
Or bosom full of languid fire,—
A gust of passion never tore
My spirit with such pangs before.
Another time, so willed it Fate,
Immersed in secret thought I stand
And grasp a stirrup fortunate—
Her foot was in my other hand.
Again imagination blazed,
The contact of the foot I raised
Rekindled in my withered heart
The fires of passion and its smart—
Away! and cease to ring their praise
For ever with thy tattling lyre,
The proud ones are not worth the fire
Of passion they so often raise.
The words and looks of charmers sweet
Are oft deceptive—like their feet.
Where is Onéguine? Half asleep,
Straight from the ball to bed he goes,
Whilst Petersburg from slumber deep
The drum already doth arouse.
The shopman and the pedlar rise
And to the Bourse the cabman plies;
The Okhtenka with pitcher speeds,
Crunching the morning snow she treads;
Morning awakes with joyous sound;
The shutters open; to the skies
In column blue the smoke doth rise;
The German baker looks around
His shop, a night-cap on his head,
And pauses oft to serve out bread.
But turning morning into night,
Tired by the ball's incessant noise,
The votary of vain delight
Sleep in the shadowy couch enjoys,
Late in the afternoon to rise,
When the same life before him lies
Till morn—life uniform but gay,
To-morrow just like yesterday.
But was our friend Eugene content,
Free, in the blossom of his spring,
Amidst successes flattering
And pleasure's daily blandishment,
Or vainly 'mid luxurious fare
Was he in health and void of care?—
Even so! His passions soon abated,
Hateful the hollow world became,
Nor long his mind was agitated
By love's inevitable flame.
For treachery had done its worst;
Friendship and friends he likewise curst,
Because he could not gourmandise
Daily beefsteaks and Strasbourg pies
And irrigate them with champagne;
Nor slander viciously could spread
Whene'er he had an aching head;
And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
He finally lost all delight
In bullets, sabres, and in fight.
His malady, whose cause I ween
It now to investigate is time,
Was nothing but the British spleen
Transported to our Russian clime.
It gradually possessed his mind;
Though, God be praised! he ne'er designed
To slay himself with blade or ball,
Indifferent he became to all,
And like Childe Harold gloomily
He to the festival repairs,
Nor boston nor the world's affairs
Nor tender glance nor amorous sigh
Impressed him in the least degree,—
Callous to all he seemed to be.
Ye miracles of courtly grace,
He left you first, and I must own
The manners of the highest class
Have latterly vexatious grown;
And though perchance a lady may
Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
Yet as a rule their talk I call
Harmless, but quite nonsensical.
Then they're so innocent of vice,
So full of piety, correct,
So prudent, and so circumspect
Stately, devoid of prejudice,
So inaccessible to men,
Their looks alone produce the spleen.
And you, my youthful damsels fair,
Whom latterly one often meets
Urging your droshkies swift as air
Along Saint Petersburg's paved streets,
From you too Eugene took to flight,
Abandoning insane delight,
And isolated from all men,
Yawning betook him to a pen.
He thought to write, but labour long
Inspired him with disgust and so
Nought from his pen did ever flow,
And thus he never fell among
That vicious set whom I don't blame—
Because a member I became.
Once more to idleness consigned,
He felt the laudable desire
From mere vacuity of mind
The wit of others to acquire.
A case of books he doth obtain—
He reads at random, reads in vain.
This nonsense, that dishonest seems,
This wicked, that absurd he deems,
All are constrained and fetters bear,
Antiquity no pleasure gave,
The moderns of the ancients rave—
Books he abandoned like the fair,
His book-shelf instantly doth drape
With taffety instead of crape.
Having abjured the haunts of men,
Like him renouncing vanity,
His friendship I acquired just then;
His character attracted me.
An innate love of meditation,
Original imagination,
And cool sagacious mind he had:
I was incensed and he was sad.
Both were of passion satiate
And both of dull existence tired,
Extinct the flame which once had fired;
Both were expectant of the hate
With which blind Fortune oft betrays
The very morning of our days.
He who hath lived and living, thinks,
Must e'en despise his kind at last;
He who hath suffered ofttimes shrinks
From shades of the relentless past.
No fond illusions live to soothe,
But memory like a serpent's tooth
With late repentance gnaws and stings.
All this in many cases brings
A charm with it in conversation.
Onéguine's speeches I abhorred
At first, but soon became inured
To the sarcastic observation,
To witticisms and taunts half-vicious
And gloomy epigrams malicious.
How oft, when on a summer night
Transparent o'er the Neva beamed
The firmament in mellow light,
And when the watery mirror gleamed
No more with pale Diana's rays,
We called to mind our youthful days—
The days of love and of romance!
Then would we muse as in a trance,
Impressionable for an hour,
And breathe the balmy breath of night;
And like the prisoner's our delight
Who for the greenwood quits his tower,
As on the rapid wings of thought
The early days of life we sought.
Absorbed in melancholy mood
And o'er the granite coping bent,
Onéguine meditative stood,
E'en as the poet says he leant.
'Tis silent all! Alone the cries
Of the night sentinels arise
And from the Millionaya afar
The sudden rattling of a car.
Lo! on the sleeping river borne,
A boat with splashing oar floats by,
And now we hear delightedly
A jolly song and distant horn;
But sweeter in a midnight dream
Torquato Tasso's strains I deem.
Ye billows of blue Hadria's sea,
O Brenta, once more we shall meet
And, inspiration firing me,
Your magic voices I shall greet,
Whose tones Apollo's sons inspire,
And after Albion's proud lyre
Possess my love and sympathy.
The nights of golden Italy
I'll pass beneath the firmament,
Hid in the gondola's dark shade,
Alone with my Venetian maid,
Now talkative, now reticent;
From her my lips shall learn the tongue
Of love which whilom Petrarch sung.
When will my hour of freedom come!
Time, I invoke thee! favouring gales
Awaiting on the shore I roam
And beckon to the passing sails.
Upon the highway of the sea
When shall I wing my passage free
On waves by tempests curdled o'er!
'Tis time to quit this weary shore
So uncongenial to my mind,
To dream upon the sunny strand
Of Africa, ancestral land,
Of dreary Russia left behind,
Wherein I felt love's fatal dart,
Wherein I buried left my heart.
Eugene designed with me to start
And visit many a foreign clime,
But Fortune cast our lots apart
For a protracted space of time.
Just at that time his father died,
And soon Onéguine's door beside
Of creditors a hungry rout
Their claims and explanations shout.
But Eugene, hating litigation
And with his lot in life content,
To a surrender gave consent,
Seeing in this no deprivation,
Or counting on his uncle's death
And what the old man might bequeath.
And in reality one day
The steward sent a note to tell
How sick to death his uncle lay
And wished to say to him farewell.
Having this mournful document
Perused, Eugene in postchaise went
And hastened to his uncle's side,
But in his heart dissatisfied,
Having for money's sake alone
Sorrow to counterfeit and wail—
Thus we began our little tale—
But, to his uncle's mansion flown,
He found him on the table laid,
A due which must to earth be paid.
The courtyard full of serfs he sees,
And from the country all around
Had come both friends and enemies—
Funeral amateurs abound!
The body they consigned to rest,
And then made merry pope and guest,
With serious air then went away
As men who much had done that day.
Lo! my Onéguine rural lord!
Of mines and meadows, woods and lakes,
He now a full possession takes,
He who economy abhorred,
Delighted much his former ways
To vary for a few brief days.
For two whole days it seemed a change
To wander through the meadows still,
The cool dark oaken grove to range,
To listen to the rippling rill.
But on the third of grove and mead
He took no more the slightest heed;
They made him feel inclined to doze;
And the conviction soon arose,
Ennui can in the country dwell
Though without palaces and streets,
Cards, balls, routs, poetry or fêtes;
On him spleen mounted sentinel
And like his shadow dogged his life,
Or better,—like a faithful wife.
I was for calm existence made,
For rural solitude and dreams,
My lyre sings sweeter in the shade
And more imagination teems.
On innocent delights I dote,
Upon my lake I love to float,
For law I far niente take
And every morning I awake
The child of sloth and liberty.
I slumber much, a little read,
Of fleeting glory take no heed.
In former years thus did not I
In idleness and tranquil joy
The happiest days of life employ?
Love, flowers, the country, idleness
And fields my joys have ever been;
I like the difference to express
Between myself and my Eugene,
Lest the malicious reader or
Some one or other editor
Of keen sarcastic intellect
Herein my portrait should detect,
And impiously should declare,
To sketch myself that I have tried
Like Byron, bard of scorn and pride,
As if impossible it were
To write of any other elf
Than one's own fascinating self.
Here I remark all poets are
Love to idealize inclined;
I have dreamed many a vision fair
And the recesses of my mind
Retained the image, though short-lived,
Which afterwards the muse revived.
Thus carelessly I once portrayed
Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
The captives of the Salguir's shore.
But now a question in this wise
Oft upon friendly lips doth rise:
Whom doth thy plaintive Muse adore?
To whom amongst the jealous throng
Of maids dost thou inscribe thy song?
Whose glance reflecting inspiration
With tenderness hath recognized
Thy meditative incantation—
Whom hath thy strain immortalized?
None, be my witness Heaven above!
The malady of hopeless love
I have endured without respite.
Happy who thereto can unite
Poetic transport. They impart
A double force unto their song
Who following Petrarch move along
And ease the tortures of the heart—
Perchance they laurels also cull—
But I, in love, was mute and dull.
The Muse appeared, when love passed by
And my dark soul to light was brought;
Free, I renewed the idolatry
Of harmony enshrining thought.
I write, and anguish flies away,
Nor doth my absent pen portray
Around my stanzas incomplete
Young ladies' faces and their feet.
Extinguished ashes do not blaze—
I mourn, but tears I cannot shed—
Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
Time will the ravages efface—
When that time comes, a poem I'll strive
To write in cantos twenty-five.
I've thought well o'er the general plan,
The hero's name too in advance,
Meantime I'll finish whilst I can
Canto the First of this romance.
I've scanned it with a jealous eye,
Discovered much absurdity,
But will not modify a tittle—
I owe the censorship a little.
For journalistic deglutition
I yield the fruit of work severe.
Go, on the Neva's bank appear,
My very latest composition!
Enjoy the meed which Fame bestows—
Misunderstanding, words and blows.
The village wherein yawned Eugene
Was a delightful little spot,
There friends of pure delight had been
Grateful to Heaven for their lot.
The lonely mansion-house to screen
From gales a hill behind was seen;
Before it ran a stream. Behold!
Afar, where clothed in green and gold
Meadows and cornfields are displayed,
Villages in the distance show
And herds of oxen wandering low;
Whilst nearer, sunk in deeper shade,
A thick immense neglected grove
Extended—haunt which Dryads love.
'Twas built, the venerable pile,
As lordly mansions ought to be,
In solid, unpretentious style,
The style of wise antiquity.
Lofty the chambers one and all,
Silk tapestry upon the wall,
Imperial portraits hang around
And stoves of various shapes abound.
All this I know is out of date,
I cannot tell the reason why,
But Eugene, incontestably,
The matter did not agitate,
Because he yawned at the bare view
Of drawing-rooms or old or new.
He took the room wherein the old
Man—forty years long in this wise—
Look through the window and kill flies.
His housekeeper was wont to scold,
Two cupboards, table, soft divan,
'Twas plain—an oaken floor ye scan,
Onéguine oped the cupboards wide.
And not a speck of dirt descried.
Here bottles stand in close array,
In one he doth accounts behold,
An almanac but eight years old.
There jars of cider block the way,
His uncle, busy man indeed,
No other book had time to read.
Eugene at first began to dream,
Alone amid possessions great,
Of many an economic scheme;
If but to lighten Time's dull rate,
The ancient barshtchina replaced
This anchorite amid his waste
The peasant blessed his happy fate.
By an obrok's indulgent rate:
Unto his neighbour, man of thrift,
But this a heinous crime appeared
And many another slily sneered;
Who secretly denounced the gift,
And all with one accord agreed,
He was a dangerous fool indeed.
But since to the backdoor they led
All visited him at first, of course;
Upon the Don's broad pastures bred
Most usually a Cossack horse
Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
If they but heard domestic loads
All overtures of friendship ended.
Most by this circumstance offended
He's a freemason, so we think.
"Oh! what a fool our neighbour is!
A lady's hand doth never kiss.
Alone he doth his claret drink,
'Tis yes! no! never madam! sir!”
This was his social character.
A new proprietor arrived,
Into the district then to boot
The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
From whose analysis minute
From Gottingen inspired he came,
Vladimir Lenski was his name,
A young and handsome galliard.
A worshipper of Kant, a bard,
The fruits of learning and combined
He brought from mystic Germany
Idolatry of liberty,
A fiery and eccentric mind,
A wild enthusiastic tongue,
Black curls which to his shoulders hung.
The pervert world with icy chill
His heart reciprocated still
Had not yet withered his young breast.
He was a dear delightful fool—
When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
The riot of the world and glare
A nursling yet for Hope to school.
And by a sweet delusion he
Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
He deemed of human life the goal
Would soothe the doubtings of his soul,
To be a charming mystery:
He racked his brains to find its clue
And marvels deemed he thus should view.
This he believed: a kindred spirit
Impelled to union with his own
Lay languishing both day and night—
Waiting his coming—his alone!
He deemed his friends but longed to make
Great sacrifices for his sake!
That a friend's arm in every case
Felled a calumniator base!
That chosen heroes consecrate,
Friends of the sons of every land,
Exist—that their immortal band
Shall surely, be it soon or late,
Pour on this orb a dazzling light
And bless mankind with full delight.
Compassion now or wrath inspires
And now philanthropy his soul,
And now his youthful heart desires
The path which leads to glory's goal.
His harp beneath that sky had rung
Where sometime Goethe, Schiller sung,
And at the altar of their fame
He kindled his poetic flame.
But from the Muses' loftiest height
The gifted songster never swerved,
But proudly in his song preserved
An ever transcendental flight;
His transports were quite maidenly,
Charming with grave simplicity.
He sang of love—to love a slave.
His ditties were as pure and bright
As thoughts which gentle maidens have,
As a babe's slumber, or the light
Of the moon in the tranquil skies,
Goddess of lovers' tender sighs.
He sang of separation grim,
Of what not, and of distant dim,
Of roses to romancers dear;
To foreign lands he would allude,
Where long time he in solitude
Had let fall many a bitter tear:
He sang of life's fresh colours stained
Before he eighteen years attained.
Since Eugene in that solitude
Gifts such as these alone could prize,
A scant attendance Lenski showed
At neighbouring hospitalities.
He shunned those parties boisterous;
The conversation tedious
About the crop of hay, the wine,
The kennel or a kindred line,
Was certainly not erudite
Nor sparkled with poetic fire,
Nor wit, nor did the same inspire
A sense of social delight,
But still more stupid did appear
The gossip of their ladies fair.
Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood
Lenski as a good match received,—
Such is the country custom good;
All mothers their sweet girls believed
Suitable for this semi-Russian.
He enters: rapidly discussion
Shifts, tacks about, until they prate
The sorrows of a single state.
Perchance where Dunia pours out tea
The young proprietor we find;
To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!
And a guitar produced we see,
And Heavens! warbled forth we hear:
Come to my golden palace, dear!
But Lenski, having no desire
Vows matrimonial to break,
With our Onéguine doth aspire
Acquaintance instantly to make.
They met. Earth, water, prose and verse,
Or ice and flame, are not diverse
If they were similar in aught.
At first such contradictions wrought
Mutual repulsion and ennui,
But grown familiar side by side
On horseback every day they ride—
Inseparable soon they be.
Thus oft—this I myself confess—
Men become friends from idleness.
But even thus not now-a-days!
In spite of common sense we're wont
As cyphers others to appraise,
Ourselves as unities to count;
And like Napoleons each of us
A million bipeds reckons thus
One instrument for his own use—
Feeling is silly, dangerous.
Eugene, more tolerant than this
(Though certainly mankind he knew
And usually despised it too),
Exceptionless as no rule is,
A few of different temper deemed,
Feeling in others much esteemed.
With smiling face he Lenski hears;
The poet's fervid conversation
And judgment which unsteady veers
And eye which gleams with inspiration—
All this was novel to Eugene.
The cold reply with gloomy mien
He oft upon his lips would curb,
Thinking: 'tis foolish to disturb
This evanescent boyish bliss.
Time without me will lessons give,
So meantime let him joyous live
And deem the world perfection is!
Forgive the fever youth inspires,
And youthful madness, youthful fires.
The gulf between them was so vast,
Debate commanded ample food—
The laws of generations past,
The fruits of science, evil, good,
The prejudices all men have,
The fatal secrets of the grave,
And life and fate in turn selected
Were to analysis subjected.
The fervid poet would recite,
Carried away by ecstasy,
Fragments of northern poetry,
Whilst Eugene condescending quite,
Though scarcely following what was said,
Attentive listened to the lad.
But more the passions occupy
The converse of our hermits twain,
And, heaving a regretful sigh,
An exile from their troublous reign,
Eugene would speak regarding these.
Thrice happy who their agonies
Hath suffered but indifferent grown,
Still happier he who ne'er hath known!
By absence who hath chilled his love,
His hate by slander, and who spends
Existence without wife or friends,
Whom jealous transport cannot move,
And who the rent-roll of his race
Ne'er trusted to the treacherous ace.
When, wise at length, we seek repose
Beneath the flag of Quietude,
When Passion's fire no longer glows
And when her violence reviewed—
Each gust of temper, silly word,
Seems so unnatural and absurd:
Reduced with effort unto sense,
We hear with interest intense
The accents wild of other's woes,
They stir the heart as heretofore.
So ancient warriors, battles o'er,
A curious interest disclose
In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
Lost in the hamlet far away.
And in addition youth is flame
And cannot anything conceal,
Is ever ready to proclaim
The love, hate, sorrow, joy, we feel.
Deeming himself a veteran scarred
In love's campaigns Onéguine heard
With quite a lachrymose expression
The youthful poet's fond confession.
He with an innocence extreme
His inner consciousness laid bare,
And Eugene soon discovered there
The story of his young love's dream,
Where plentifully feelings flow
Which we experienced long ago.
Alas! he loved as in our times
Men love no more, as only the
Mad spirit of the man who rhymes
Is still condemned in love to be;
One image occupied his mind,
Constant affection intertwined
And an habitual sense of pain;
And distance interposed in vain,
Nor years of separation all
Nor homage which the Muse demands
Nor beauties of far distant lands
Nor study, banquet, rout nor ball
His constant soul could ever tire,
Which glowed with virginal desire.
When but a boy he Olga loved
Unknown as yet the aching heart,
He witnessed tenderly and moved
Her girlish gaiety and sport.
Beneath the sheltering oak tree's shade
He with his little maiden played,
Whilst the fond parents, friends thro' life,
Dreamed in the future man and wife.
And full of innocent delight,
As in a thicket's humble shade,
Beneath her parents' eyes the maid
Grew like a lily pure and white,
Unseen in thick and tangled grass
By bee and butterfly which pass.
'Twas she who first within his breast
Poetic transport did infuse,
And thoughts of Olga first impressed
A mournful temper on his Muse.
Farewell! thou golden days of love!
'Twas then he loved the tangled grove
And solitude and calm delight,
The moon, the stars, and shining night—
The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
To whom we used to consecrate
A promenade in twilight late
With tears which secret sufferers love—
But now in her effulgence pale
A substitute for lamps we hail!
Obedient she had ever been
And modest, cheerful as the morn,
As a poetic life serene,
Sweet as the kiss of lovers sworn.
Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
Her locks were of a golden hue,
Her movements, voice and figure slight,
All about Olga—to a light
Romance of love I pray refer,
You'll find her portrait there, I vouch;
I formerly admired her much
But finally grew bored by her.
But with her elder sister I
Must now my stanzas occupy.
Tattiana was her appellation.
We are the first who such a name
In pages of a love narration
With such a perversity proclaim.
But wherefore not?—'Tis pleasant, nice,
Euphonious, though I know a spice
It carries of antiquity
And of the attic. Honestly,
We must admit but little taste
Doth in us or our names appear
(I speak not of our poems here),
And education runs to waste,
Endowing us from out her store
With affectation,—nothing more.
And so Tattiana was her name,
Nor by her sister's brilliancy
Nor by her beauty she became
The cynosure of every eye.
Shy, silent did the maid appear
As in the timid forest deer,
Even beneath her parents' roof
Stood as estranged from all aloof,
Nearest and dearest knew not how
To fawn upon and love express;
A child devoid of childishness
To romp and play she ne'er would go:
Oft staring through the window pane
Would she in silence long remain.
Contemplativeness, her delight,
E'en from her cradle's earliest dream,
Adorned with many a vision bright
Of rural life the sluggish stream;
Ne'er touched her fingers indolent
ETOT FILE CHISTIL MAXIM KATKOV
The needle nor, o'er framework bent,
Would she the canvas tight enrich
With gay design and silken stitch.
Desire to rule ye may observe
When the obedient doll in sport
An infant maiden doth exhort
Polite demeanour to preserve,
Gravely repeating to another
Recent instructions of its mother.
But Tania ne'er displayed a passion
For dolls, e'en from her earliest years,
And gossip of the town and fashion
She ne'er repeated unto hers.
Strange unto her each childish game,
But when the winter season came
And dark and drear the evenings were,
Terrible tales she loved to hear.
And when for Olga nurse arrayed
In the broad meadow a gay rout,
All the young people round about,
At prisoner's base she never played.
Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
Their giddy sports she ne'er enjoyed.
She loved upon the balcony
To anticipate the break of day,
When on the pallid eastern sky
The starry beacons fade away,
The horizon luminous doth grow,
Morning's forerunners, breezes blow
And gradually day unfolds.
In winter, when Night longer holds
A hemisphere beneath her sway,
Longer the East inert reclines
Beneath the moon which dimly shines,
And calmly sleeps the hours away,
At the same hour she oped her eyes
And would by candlelight arise.
Romances pleased her from the first,
Her all in all did constitute;
In love adventures she was versed,
Rousseau and Richardson to boot.
Not a bad fellow was her father
Though superannuated rather;
In books he saw nought to condemn
But, as he never opened them,
Viewed them with not a little scorn,
And gave himself but little pain
His daughter's book to ascertain
Which 'neath her pillow lay till morn.
His wife was also mad upon
The works of Mr. Richardson.
She was thus fond of Richardson
Not that she had his works perused,
Or that adoring Grandison
That rascal Lovelace she abused;
But that Princess Pauline of old,
Her Moscow cousin, often told
The tale of these romantic men;
Her husband was a bridegroom then,
And she despite herself would waste
Sighs on another than her lord
Whose qualities appeared to afford
More satisfaction to her taste.
Her Grandison was in the Guard,
A noted fop who gambled hard.
Like his, her dress was always nice,
The height of fashion, fitting tight,
But contrary to her advice
The girl in marriage they unite.
Then, her distraction to allay,
The bridegroom sage without delay
Removed her to his country seat,
Where God alone knows whom she met.
She struggled hard at first thus pent,
Night separated from her spouse,
Then became busy with the house,
First reconciled and then content;
Habit was given us in distress
By Heaven in lieu of happiness.
Habit alleviates the grief
Inseparable from our lot;
This great discovery relief
And consolation soon begot.
And then she soon 'twixt work and leisure
Found out the secret how at pleasure
To dominate her worthy lord,
And harmony was soon restored.
The workpeople she superintended,
Mushrooms for winter salted down,
Kept the accounts, shaved many a crown,
The bath on Saturdays attended,
When angry beat her maids, I grieve,
And all without her husband's leave.
In her friends' albums, time had been,
With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
Baptized Prascovia Pauline,
And in her conversation drawled.
She wore her corset tightly bound,
The Russian N with nasal sound
She would pronounce à la Française;
But soon she altered all her ways,
Corset and album and Pauline,
Her sentimental verses all,
She soon forgot, began to call
Akulka who was once Celine,
And had with waddling in the end
Her caps and night-dresses to mend.
As for her spouse he loved her dearly,
In her affairs ne'er interfered,
Entrusted all to her sincerely,
In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
Existence calmly sped along,
And oft at eventide a throng
Of friends unceremonious would
Assemble from the neighbourhood:
They growl a bit—they scandalise—
They crack a feeble joke and smile—
Thus the time passes and meanwhile
Olga the tea must supervise—
'Tis time for supper, now for bed,
And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
They in a peaceful life preserved
Customs by ages sanctified,
Strictly the Carnival observed,
Ate Russian pancakes at Shrovetide,
Twice in the year to fast were bound,
Of whirligigs were very fond,
Of Christmas carols, song and dance;
When people with long countenance
On Trinity Sunday yawned at prayer,
Three tears they dropt with humble mein
Upon a bunch of lovage green;
Kvass needful was to them as air;
On guests their servants used to wait
By rank as settled by the State.
Thus age approached, the common doom,
And death before the husband wide
Opened the portals of the tomb
And a new diadem supplied.
Just before dinner-time he slept,
By neighbouring families bewept,
By children and by faithful wife
With deeper woe than others' grief.
He was an honest gentleman,
And where at last his bones repose
The epitaph on marble shows:
Demetrius Larine, sinful man,
Servant of God and brigadier,
Enjoyeth peaceful slumber here.
To his Penates now returned,
Vladimir Lenski visited
His neighbour's lowly tomb and mourned
Above the ashes of the dead.
There long time sad at heart he stayed:
"Poor Yorick,” mournfully he said,
"How often in thine arms I lay;
How with thy medal I would play,
The Medal Otchakoff conferred!
To me he would his Olga give,
Would whisper: shall I so long live?”—
And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
Lenski his pencil-case took out
And an elegiac poem wrote.
Likewise an epitaph with tears
He writes upon his parents' tomb,
And thus ancestral dust reveres.
Oh! on the fields of life how bloom
Harvests of souls unceasingly
By Providence's dark decree!
They blossom, ripen and they fall
And others rise ephemeral!
Thus our light race grows up and lives,
A moment effervescing stirs,
Then seeks ancestral sepulchres,
The appointed hour arrives, arrives!
And our successors soon shall drive
Us from the world wherein we live.
Meantime, drink deeply of the flow
Of frivolous existence, friends;
Its insignificance I know
And care but little for its ends.
To dreams I long have closed mine eyes,
Yet sometimes banished hopes will rise
And agitate my heart again;
And thus it is 'twould cause me pain
Without the faintest trace to leave
This world. I do not praise desire,
Yet still apparently aspire
My mournful fate in verse to weave,
That like a friendly voice its tone
Rescue me from oblivion.
Perchance some heart 'twill agitate,
And then the stanzas of my theme
Will not, preserved by kindly Fate,
Perish absorbed by Lethe's stream.
Then it may be, O flattering tale,
Some future ignoramus shall
My famous portrait indicate
And cry: he was a poet great!
My gratitude do not disdain,
Admirer of the peaceful Muse,
Whose memory doth not refuse
My light productions to retain,
Whose hands indulgently caress
The bays of age and helplessness.
"Whither away? Deuce take the bard!”—
"Good-bye, Onéguine, I must go.”—
"I won't detain you; but 'tis hard
To guess how you the eve pull through.”—
"At Làrina's.”—"Hem, that is queer!
Pray is it not a tough affair
Thus to assassinate the eve?”—
"Not at all.”—"That I can't conceive!
'Tis something of this sort I deem.
In the first place, say, am I right?
A Russian household simple quite,
Who welcome guests with zeal extreme,
Preserves and an eternal prattle
About the rain and flax and cattle.”—
"No misery I see in that”—
"Boredom, my friend, behold the ill—”
"Your fashionable world I hate,
Domestic life attracts me still,
Where—”—"What! another eclogue spin?
For God's sake, Lenski, don't begin!
What! really going? 'Tis too bad!
But Lenski, I should be so glad
Would you to me this Phyllis show,
Fair source of every fine idea,
Verses and tears et cetera.
Present me.”—"You are joking.”—"No.”—
"Delighted.”—"When?”—"This very night.
They will receive us with delight.”
Whilst homeward by the nearest route
Our heroes at full gallop sped,
Can we not stealthily make out
What they in conversation said?—
"How now, Onéguine, yawning still?”—
"'Tis habit, Lenski.”—"Is your ill
More troublesome than usual?”—"No!
How dark the night is getting though!
Hallo, Andriushka, onward race!
The drive becomes monotonous—
Well! Làrina appears to us
An ancient lady full of grace.—
That bilberry wine, I'm sore afraid,
The deuce with my inside has played.”
"Say, of the two which was Tattiana?”
"She who with melancholy face
And silent as the maid Svetlana
Hard by the window took her place.”—
"The younger, you're in love with her!”
"Well!”—"I the elder should prefer,
Were I like you a bard by trade—
In Olga's face no life's displayed.
'Tis a Madonna of Vandyk,
An oval countenance and pink,
Yon silly moon upon the brink
Of the horizon she is like!”—
Vladimir something curtly said
Nor further comment that night made.
Meantime Onéguine's apparition
At Làrina's abode produced
Quite a sensation; the position
To all good neighbours' sport conduced.
Endless conjectures all propound
And secretly their views expound.
What jokes and guesses now abound,
A beau is for Tattiana found!
In fact, some people were assured
The wedding-day had been arranged,
But the date subsequently changed
Till proper rings could be procured.
On Lenski's matrimonial fate
They long ago had held debate.
Of course Tattiana was annoyed
By such allusions scandalous,
Yet was her inmost soul o'erjoyed
With satisfaction marvellous,
As in her heart the thought sank home,
I am in love, my hour hath come!
Thus in the earth the seed expands
Obedient to warm Spring's commands.
Long time her young imagination
By indolence and languor fired
The fated nutriment desired;
And long internal agitation
Had filled her youthful breast with gloom,
She waited for—I don't know whom!
The fatal hour had come at last—
She oped her eyes and cried: 'tis he!
Alas! for now before her passed
The same warm vision constantly;
Now all things round about repeat
Ceaselessly to the maiden sweet
His name: the tenderness of home
Tiresome unto her hath become
And the kind-hearted servitors:
Immersed in melancholy thought,
She hears of conversation nought
And hated casual visitors,
Their coming which no man expects,
And stay whose length none recollects.
Now with what eager interest
She the delicious novel reads,
With what avidity and zest
She drinks in those seductive deeds!
All the creations which below
From happy inspiration flow,
The swain of Julia Wolmar,
Malek Adel and De Linar,
Werther, rebellious martyr bold,
And that unrivalled paragon,
The sleep-compelling Grandison,
Our tender dreamer had enrolled
A single being: 'twas in fine
No other than Onéguine mine.
Dreaming herself the heroine
Of the romances she preferred,
Clarissa, Julia, Delphine,—
Tattiana through the forest erred,
And the bad book accompanies.
Upon those pages she descries
Her passion's faithful counterpart,
Fruit of the yearnings of the heart.
She heaves a sigh and deep intent
On raptures, sorrows not her own,
She murmurs in an undertone
A letter for her hero meant:
That hero, though his merit shone,
Was certainly no Grandison.
Alas! my friends, the years flit by
And after them at headlong pace
The evanescent fashions fly
In motley and amusing chase.
The world is ever altering!
Farthingales, patches, were the thing,
And courtier, fop, and usurer
Would once in powdered wig appear;
Time was, the poet's tender quill
In hopes of everlasting fame
A finished madrigal would frame
Or couplets more ingenious still;
Time was, a valiant general might
Serve who could neither read nor write.
Time was, in style magniloquent
Authors replete with sacred fire
Their heroes used to represent
All that perfection could desire;
Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
Their idols they were wont to invest
With intellect, a taste refined,
And handsome countenance combined,
A heart wherein pure passion burnt;
The excited hero in a trice
Was ready for self-sacrifice,
And in the final tome we learnt,
Vice had due punishment awarded,
Virtue was with a bride rewarded.
But now our minds are mystified
And Virtue acts as a narcotic,
Vice in romance is glorified
And triumphs in career erotic.
The monsters of the British Muse
Deprive our schoolgirls of repose,
The idols of their adoration
A Vampire fond of meditation,
Or Melmoth, gloomy wanderer he,
The Eternal Jew or the Corsair
Or the mysterious Sbogar.
Byron's capricious phantasy
Could in romantic mantle drape
E'en hopeless egoism's dark shape.
My friends, what means this odd digression?
May be that I by heaven's decrees
Shall abdicate the bard's profession,
And shall adopt some new caprice.
Thus having braved Apollo's rage
With humble prose I'll fill my page
And a romance in ancient style
Shall my declining years beguile;
Nor shall my pen paint terribly
The torment born of crime unseen,
But shall depict the touching scene
Of Russian domesticity;
I will descant on love's sweet dream,
The olden time shall be my theme.
Old people's simple conversations
My unpretending page shall fill,
Their offspring's innocent flirtations
By the old lime-tree or the rill,
Their Jealousy and separation
And tears of reconciliation:
Fresh cause of quarrel then I'll find,
But finally in wedlock bind.
The passionate speeches I'll repeat,
Accents of rapture or despair
I uttered to my lady fair
Long ago, prostrate at her feet.
Then they came easily enow,
My tongue is somewhat rusty now.
Tattiana! sweet Tattiana, see!
What bitter tears with thee I shed!
Thou hast resigned thy destiny
Unto a ruthless tyrant dread.
Thou'lt suffer, dearest, but before,
Hope with her fascinating power
To dire contentment shall give birth
And thou shalt taste the joys of earth.
Thou'lt quaff love's sweet envenomed stream,
Fantastic images shall swarm
In thy imagination warm,
Of happy meetings thou shalt dream,
And wheresoe'er thy footsteps err,
Confront thy fated torturer!
Love's pangs Tattiana agonize.
She seeks the garden in her need—
Sudden she stops, casts down her eyes
And cares not farther to proceed;
Her bosom heaves whilst crimson hues
With sudden flush her cheeks suffuse,
Barely to draw her breath she seems,
Her eye with fire unwonted gleams.
And now 'tis night, the guardian moon
Sails her allotted course on high,
And from the misty woodland nigh
The nightingale trills forth her tune;
Restless Tattiana sleepless lay
And thus unto her nurse did say:
"Nurse, 'tis so close I cannot rest.
Open the window—sit by me.”
"What ails thee, dear?”—"I feel depressed.
Relate some ancient history.”
"But which, my dear?—In days of yore
Within my memory I bore
Many an ancient legend which
In monsters and fair dames was rich;
But now my mind is desolate,
What once I knew is clean forgot—
Alas! how wretched now my lot!”
"But tell me, nurse, can you relate
The days which to your youth belong?
Were you in love when you were young?”—
"Alack! Tattiana,” she replied,
"We never loved in days of old,
My mother-in-law who lately died
Had killed me had the like been told.”
"How came you then to wed a man?”—
"Why, as God ordered! My Ivan
Was younger than myself, my light,
For I myself was thirteen quite;
The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
Her suit before my parents pressing:
At last my father gave his blessing,
And bitter tears of fright I shed.
Weeping they loosed my tresses long
And led me off to church with song.”
"Then amongst strangers I was left—
But I perceive thou dost not heed—”
"Alas! dear nurse, my heart is cleft,
Mortally sick I am indeed.
Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain—”
"My darling child, thou art in pain.—
The Lord deliver her and save!
Tell me at once what wilt thou have?
I'll sprinkle thee with holy water.—
How thy hands burn!”—"Dear nurse, I'm well.
I am—in love—you know—don't tell!”
"The Lord be with thee, O my daughter!”—
And the old nurse a brief prayer said
And crossed with trembling hand the maid.
"I am in love,” her whispers tell
The aged woman in her woe:
"My heart's delight, thou art not well.”—
"I am in love, nurse! leave me now.”
Behold! the moon was shining bright
And showed with an uncertain light
Tattiana's beauty, pale with care,
Her tears and her dishevelled hair;
And on the footstool sitting down
Beside our youthful heroine fair,
A kerchief round her silver hair
The aged nurse in ample gown,
Whilst all creation seemed to dream
Enchanted by the moon's pale beam.
But borne in spirit far away
Tattiana gazes on the moon,
And starting suddenly doth say:
"Nurse, leave me. I would be alone.
Pen, paper bring: the table too
Draw near. I soon to sleep shall go—
Good-night.” Behold! she is alone!
'Tis silent—on her shines the moon—
Upon her elbow she reclines,
And Eugene ever in her soul
Indites an inconsiderate scroll
Wherein love innocently pines.
Now it is ready to be sent—
For whom, Tattiana, is it meant?
I have known beauties cold and raw
As Winter in their purity,
Striking the intellect with awe
By dull insensibility,
And I admired their common sense
And natural benevolence,
But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
For on their brows I trembling read
The inscription o'er the gates of Hell
"Abandon hope for ever here!”
Love to inspire doth woe appear
To such—delightful to repel.
Perchance upon the Neva e'en
Similar dames ye may have seen.
Amid submissive herds of men
Virgins miraculous I see,
Who selfishly unmoved remain
Alike by sighs and flattery.
But what astonished do I find
When harsh demeanour hath consigned
A timid love to banishment?—
On fresh allurements they are bent,
At least by show of sympathy;
At least their accents and their words
Appear attuned to softer chords;
And then with blind credulity
The youthful lover once again
Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
Because in singleness of thought
She never of deception dreamed
But trusted the ideal she wrought?—
Because her passion wanted art,
Obeyed the impulses of heart?—
Because she was so innocent,
That Heaven her character had blent
With an imagination wild,
With intellect and strong volition
And a determined disposition,
An ardent heart and yet so mild?—
Doth love's incautiousness in her
So irremissible appear?
O ye whom tender love hath pained
Without the ken of parents both,
Whose hearts responsive have remained
To the impressions of our youth,
The all-entrancing joys of love—
Young ladies, if ye ever strove
The mystic lines to tear away
A lover's letter might convey,
Or into bold hands anxiously
Have e'er a precious tress consigned,
Or even, silent and resigned,
When separation's hour drew nigh,
Have felt love's agitated kiss
With tears, confused emotions, bliss,—
With unanimity complete,
Condemn not weak Tattiana mine;
Do not cold-bloodedly repeat
The sneers of critics superfine;
And you, O maids immaculate,
Whom vice, if named, doth agitate
E'en as the presence of a snake,
I the same admonition make.
Who knows? with love's consuming flame
Perchance you also soon may burn,
Then to some gallant in your turn
Will be ascribed by treacherous Fame
The triumph of a conquest new.
The God of Love is after you!
A coquette loves by calculation,
Tattiana's love was quite sincere,
A love which knew no limitation,
Even as the love of children dear.
She did not think "procrastination
Enhances love in estimation
And thus secures the prey we seek.
His vanity first let us pique
With hope and then perplexity,
Excruciate the heart and late
With jealous fire resuscitate,
Lest jaded with satiety,
The artful prisoner should seek
Incessantly his chains to break.”
I still a complication view,
My country's honour and repute
Demands that I translate for you
The letter which Tattiana wrote.
At Russ she was by no means clever
And read our newspapers scarce ever,
And in her native language she
Possessed nor ease nor fluency,
So she in French herself expressed.
I cannot help it I declare,
Though hitherto a lady ne'er
In Russ her love made manifest,
And never hath our language proud
In correspondence been allowed.
They wish that ladies should, I hear,
Learn Russian, but the Lord defend!
I can't conceive a little dear
With the "Well-Wisher” in her hand!
I ask, all ye who poets are,
Is it not true? the objects fair,
To whom ye for unnumbered crimes
Had to compose in secret rhymes,
To whom your hearts were consecrate,—
Did they not all the Russian tongue
With little knowledge and that wrong
In charming fashion mutilate?
Did not their lips with foreign speech
The native Russian tongue impeach?
God grant I meet not at a ball
Or at a promenade mayhap,
A schoolmaster in yellow shawl
Or a professor in tulle cap.
As rosy lips without a smile,
The Russian language I deem vile
Without grammatical mistakes.
May be, and this my terror wakes,
The fair of the next generation,
As every journal now entreats,
Will teach grammatical conceits,
Introduce verse in conversation.
But I—what is all this to me?
Will to the old times faithful be.
Speech careless, incorrect, but soft,
With inexact pronunciation
Raises within my breast as oft
As formerly much agitation.
Repentance wields not now her spell
And gallicisms I love as well
As the sins of my youthful days
Or Bogdanovitch's sweet lays.
But I must now employ my Muse
With the epistle of my fair;
I promised!—Did I so?—Well, there!
Now I am ready to refuse.
I know that Parny's tender pen
Is no more cherished amongst men.
Bard of the "Feasts,” and mournful breast,
If thou wert sitting by my side,
With this immoderate request
I should alarm our friendship tried:
In one of thine enchanting lays
To russify the foreign phrase
Of my impassioned heroine.
Where art thou? Come! pretensions mine
I yield with a low reverence;
But lonely beneath Finnish skies
Where melancholy rocks arise
He wanders in his indolence;
Careless of fame his spirit high
Hears not my importunity!
Tattiana's letter I possess,
I guard it as a holy thing,
And though I read it with distress,
I'm o'er it ever pondering.
Inspired by whom this tenderness,
This gentle daring who could guess?
Who this soft nonsense could impart,
Imprudent prattle of the heart,
Attractive in its banefulness?
I cannot understand. But lo!
A feeble version read below,
A print without the picture's grace,
Or, as it were, the Freischutz' score
Strummed by a timid schoolgirl o'er.
Tattiana's Letter to Onéguine
I write to you! Is more required?
Can lower depths beyond remain?
'Tis in your power now, if desired,
To crush me with a just disdain.
But if my lot unfortunate
You in the least commiserate
You will not all abandon me.
At first, I clung to secrecy:
Believe me, of my present shame
You never would have heard the name,
If the fond hope I could have fanned
At times, if only once a week,
To see you by our fireside stand,
To listen to the words you speak,
Address to you one single phrase
And then to meditate for days
Of one thing till again we met.
'Tis said you are a misanthrope,
In country solitude you mope,
And we—an unattractive set—
Can hearty welcome give alone.
Why did you visit our poor place?
Forgotten in the village lone,
I never should have seen your face
And bitter torment never known.
The untutored spirit's pangs calmed down
By time (who can anticipate?)
I had found my predestinate,
Become a faithful wife and e'en
A fond and careful mother been.
Another! to none other I
My heart's allegiance can resign,
My doom has been pronounced on high,
'Tis Heaven's will and I am thine.
The sum of my existence gone
But promise of our meeting gave,
I feel thou wast by God sent down
My guardian angel to the grave.
Thou didst to me in dreams appear,
Unseen thou wast already dear.
Thine eye subdued me with strange glance,
I heard thy voice's resonance
Long ago. Dream it cannot be!
Scarce hadst thou entered thee I knew,
I flushed up, stupefied I grew,
And cried within myself: 'tis he!
Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
With thee I conversed when I bore
Comfort and succour to the poor,
And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
To ease the anguish of my breast.
Nay! even as this instant fled,
Was it not thou, O vision bright,
That glimmered through the radiant night
And gently hovered o'er my head?
Was it not thou who thus didst stoop
To whisper comfort, love and hope?
Who art thou? Guardian angel sent
Or torturer malevolent?
Doubt and uncertainty decide:
All this may be an empty dream,
Delusions of a mind untried,
Providence otherwise may deem—
Then be it so! My destiny
From henceforth I confide to thee!
Lo! at thy feet my tears I pour
And thy protection I implore.
Imagine! Here alone am I!
No one my anguish comprehends,
At times my reason almost bends,
And silently I here must die—
But I await thee: scarce alive
My heart with but one look revive;
Or to disturb my dreams approach
Alas! with merited reproach.
'Tis finished. Horrible to read!
With shame I shudder and with dread—
But boldly I myself resign:
Thine honour is my countersign!
Tattiana moans and now she sighs
And in her grasp the letter shakes,
Even the rosy wafer dries
Upon her tongue which fever bakes.
Her head upon her breast declines
And an enchanting shoulder shines
From her half-open vest of night.
But lo! already the moon's light
Is waning. Yonder valley deep
Looms gray behind the mist and morn
Silvers the brook; the shepherd's horn
Arouses rustics from their sleep.
'Tis day, the family downstairs,
But nought for this Tattiana cares.
The break of day she doth not see,
But sits in bed with air depressed,
Nor on the letter yet hath she
The image of her seal impressed.
But gray Phillippevna the door
Opened with care, and entering bore
A cup of tea upon a tray.
"'Tis time, my child, arise, I pray!
My beauty, thou art ready too.
My morning birdie, yesternight
I was half silly with affright.
But praised be God! in health art thou!
The pains of night have wholly fled,
Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
"Command me, darling, what you choose”—
"Ah! nurse, a favour do for me!”—
"Do not—you might—suspicious be;
But look you—ah! do not refuse.”
"I call to witness God on high—”
"Then send your grandson quietly
To take this letter to O— Well!
Unto our neighbour. Mind you tell—
Command him not to say a word—
I mean my name not to repeat.”
Of late I have been quite absurd,—
"To whom is it to go, my sweet?
Am I to go through the whole list?”
So many neighbours here exist—
"How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
"My darling, growing old am I!
In age the memory gets worse,
But I was sharp in times gone by.
In times gone by thy bare command—”
"Oh! nurse, nurse, you don't understand!
What is thy cleverness to me?
The letter is the thing, you see,—
Onéguine's letter!”—"Ah! the thing!
Now don't be cross with me, my soul,
But why are your cheeks whitening?”
You know that I am now a fool—
But send your grandson before long.”
"Nothing, good nurse, there's nothing wrong,
No answer all that day was borne.
Another passed; 'twas just the same.
Pale as a ghost and dressed since morn
Tattiana waits. No answer came!
Olga's admirer came that day:
"Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
"He hath neglected us of late.”—
The hostess doth interrogate:
"He promised here this day to ride,”
Tattiana blushed, her heart beat quick—
"The post hath kept him, it is like.”
Lenski unto the dame replied,
Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
As if he cruelly had joked!
Shrill sang the samovar at eve,
'Twas dusk! Upon the table bright
In clouds of steam above perceive.
The china teapot too ye might
By Olga's hand distributed
Into the cups already sped
And a boy handed round the cream.
The fragrant tea in darkling stream,
And breathes upon the chilly glass,
Tania doth by the casement linger
And traces with a slender finger
Dreaming of what not, pretty lass,
Upon its damp opacity,
The mystic monogram, O. E.
Her weary eyes are filled with tears—
In the meantime her spirit sinks,
Nearer they come—Eugene appears!
A horse's hoofs she hears—She shrinks!
More swift the room Tattiana fled,
Ah! than a spectre from the dead
Not daring to cast back her eyes.
From hall to yard and garden flies,
Through park and meadow, wood and brake,
She fears and like an arrow rushes
Brambles she snaps and lilacs crushes,
The bridge and alley to the lake,
Till out of breath upon a seat
The flowerbeds skirts, the brook doth meet,
She sank.—"He's here! Eugene is here!
Merciful God, what will he deem?”
Yet still her heart, which torments tear,
Guards fondly hope's uncertain dream.
She waits, on fire her trembling frame—
Will he pursue?—But no one came.
She heard of servant-maids the note,
Who in the orchards gathered fruit,
Singing in chorus all the while.
(This by command; for it was found,
However cherries might abound,
They disappeared by stealth and guile,
So mouths they stopt with song, not fruit—
Device of rural minds acute!)
The Maidens' Song
Young maidens, fair maidens,
Friends and companions,
Disport yourselves, maidens,
Arouse yourselves, fair ones.
Come sing we in chorus
The secrets of maidens.
Allure the young gallant
With dance and with song.
As we lure the young gallant,
Espy him approaching,
Disperse yourselves, darlings,
And pelt him with cherries,
With cherries, red currants,
With raspberries, cherries.
Approach not to hearken
To secrets of virgins,
Approach not to gaze at
The frolics of maidens.
They sang, whilst negligently seated,
Attentive to the echoing sound,
Tattiana with impatience waited
Until her heart less high should bound—
Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
But tremor still her frame possessed,
Nor did her blushes fade away,
More crimson every moment they.
Thus shines the wretched butterfly,
With iridescent wing doth flap
When captured in a schoolboy's cap;
Thus shakes the hare when suddenly
She from the winter corn espies
A sportsman who in covert lies.
But finally she heaves a sigh,
And rising from her bench proceeds;
But scarce had turned the corner nigh,
Which to the neighbouring alley leads,
When Eugene like a ghost did rise
Before her straight with roguish eyes.
Tattiana faltered, and became
Scarlet as burnt by inward flame.
But this adventure's consequence
To-day, my friends, at any rate,
I am not strong enough to state;
I, after so much eloquence,
Must take a walk and rest a bit—
Some day I'll somehow finish it.
The less we love a lady fair
The easier 'tis to gain her grace,
And the more surely we ensnare
Her in the pitfalls which we place.
Time was when cold seduction strove
To swagger as the art of love,
Everywhere trumpeting its feats,
Not seeking love but sensual sweets.
But this amusement delicate
Was worthy of that old baboon,
Our fathers used to dote upon;
The Lovelaces are out of date,
Their glory with their heels of red
And long perukes hath vanishèd.
For who imposture can endure,
A constant harping on one tune,
Serious endeavours to assure
What everybody long has known;
Ever to hear the same replies
And overcome antipathies
Which never have existed, e'en
In little maidens of thirteen?
And what like menaces fatigues,
Entreaties, oaths, fictitious fear,
Epistles of six sheets or near,
Rings, tears, deceptions and intrigues,
Aunts, mothers and their scrutiny,
And husbands' tedious amity?
Such were the musings of Eugene.
He in the early years of life
Had a deluded victim been
Of error and the passions' strife.
By daily life deteriorated,
Awhile this beauty captivated,
And that no longer could inspire.
Slowly exhausted by desire,
Yet satiated with success,
In solitude or worldly din,
He heard his soul's complaint within,
With laughter smothered weariness:
And thus he spent eight years of time,
Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
Though beauty he no more adored,
He still made love in a queer way;
Rebuffed—as quickly reassured,
Jilted—glad of a holiday.
Without enthusiasm he met
The fair, nor parted with regret,
Scarce mindful of their love and guile.
Thus a guest with composure will
To take a hand at whist oft come:
He takes his seat, concludes his game,
And straight returning whence he came,
Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
And in the morning doth not know
Whither that evening he will go.
However, Tania's letter reading,
Eugene was touched with sympathy;
The language of her girlish pleading
Aroused in him sweet reverie.
He called to mind Tattiana's grace,
Pallid and melancholy face,
And in a vision, sinless, bright,
His spirit sank with strange delight.
May be the empire of the sense,
Regained authority awhile,
But he desired not to beguile
Such open-hearted innocence.
But to the garden once again
Wherein we lately left the twain.
Two minutes they in silence spent,
Onéguine then approached and said:
"You have a letter to me sent.
Do not excuse yourself. I read
Confessions which a trusting heart
May well in innocence impart.
Charming is your sincerity,
Feelings which long had ceased to be
It wakens in my breast again.
But I came not to adulate:
Your frankness I shall compensate
By an avowal just as plain.
An ear to my confession lend;
To thy decree my will I bend.
"If the domestic hearth could bless—
My sum of happiness contained;
If wife and children to possess
A happy destiny ordained:
If in the scenes of home I might
E'en for an instant find delight,
Then, I say truly, none but thee
I would desire my bride to be—
I say without poetic phrase,
Found the ideal of my youth,
Thee only would I choose, in truth,
As partner of my mournful days,
Thee only, pledge of all things bright,
And be as happy—as I might.
"But strange am I to happiness;
'Tis foreign to my cast of thought;
Me your perfections would not bless;
I am not worthy them in aught;
And honestly 'tis my belief
Our union would produce but grief.
Though now my love might be intense,
Habit would bring indifference.
I see you weep. Those tears of yours
Tend not my heart to mitigate,
But merely to exasperate;
Judge then what roses would be ours,
What pleasures Hymen would prepare
For us, may be for many a year.
"What can be drearier than the house,
Wherein the miserable wife
Deplores a most unworthy spouse
And leads a solitary life?
The tiresome man, her value knowing,
Yet curses on his fate bestowing,
Is full of frigid jealousy,
Mute, solemn, frowning gloomily.
Such am I. This did ye expect,
When in simplicity ye wrote
Your innocent and charming note
With so much warmth and intellect?
Hath fate apportioned unto thee
This lot in life with stern decree?
"Ideas and time ne'er backward move;
My soul I cannot renovate—
I love you with a brother's love,
Perchance one more affectionate.
Listen to me without disdain.
A maid hath oft, may yet again
Replace the visions fancy drew;
Thus trees in spring their leaves renew
As in their turn the seasons roll.
'Tis evidently Heaven's will
You fall in love again. But still—
Learn to possess more self-control.
Not all will like myself proceed—
And thoughtlessness to woe might lead.”
Thus did our friend Onéguine preach:
Tattiana, dim with tears her eyes,
Attentive listened to his speech,
All breathless and without replies.
His arm he offers. Mute and sad
(Mechanically, let us add),
Tattiana doth accept his aid;
And, hanging down her head, the maid
Around the garden homeward hies.
Together they returned, nor word
Of censure for the same incurred;
The country hath its liberties
And privileges nice allowed,
Even as Moscow, city proud.
Confess, O ye who this peruse,
Onéguine acted very well
By poor Tattiana in the blues;
'Twas not the first time, I can tell
You, he a noble mind disclosed,
Though some men, evilly disposed,
Spared him not their asperities.
His friends and also enemies
(One and the same thing it may be)
Esteemed him much as the world goes.
Yes! every one must have his foes,
But Lord! from friends deliver me!
The deuce take friends, my friends, amends
I've had to make for having friends!
But how? Quite so. Though I dismiss
Dark, unavailing reverie,
I just hint, in parenthesis,
There is no stupid calumny
Born of a babbler in a loft
And by the world repeated oft,
There is no fishmarket retort
And no ridiculous report,
Which your true friend with a sweet smile
Where fashionable circles meet
A hundred times will not repeat,
Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
And yet he in your cause would strive
And loves you as—a relative!
Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
Are all your relatives quite well?
Permit me; is it worth the trouble
For your instruction here to tell
What I by relatives conceive?
These are your relatives, believe:
Those whom we ought to love, caress,
With spiritual tenderness;
Whom, as the custom is of men,
We visit about Christmas Day,
Or by a card our homage pay,
That until Christmas comes again
They may forget that we exist.
And so—God bless them, if He list.
In this the love of the fair sex
Beats that of friends and relatives:
In love, although its tempests vex,
Our liberty at least survives:
Agreed! but then the whirl of fashion,
The natural fickleness of passion,
The torrent of opinion,
And the fair sex as light as down!
Besides the hobbies of a spouse
Should be respected throughout life
By every proper-minded wife,
And this the faithful one allows,
When in as instant she is lost,—
Satan will jest, and at love's cost.
Oh! where bestow our love? Whom trust?
Where is he who doth not deceive?
Who words and actions will adjust
To standards in which we believe?
Oh! who is not calumnious?
Who labours hard to humour us?
To whom are our misfortunes grief
And who is not a tiresome thief?
My venerated reader, oh!
Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
Spare yourself unavailing pain
And all your love on self bestow;
A worthy object 'tis, and well
I know there's none more amiable.
But from the interview what flowed?
Alas! It is not hard to guess.
The insensate fire of love still glowed
Nor discontinued to distress
A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
Tattiana more than ever burned
With hopeless passion: from her bed
Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
Her health, life's sweetness and its bloom,
Her smile and maidenly repose,
All vanished as an echo goes.
Across her youth a shade had come,
As when the tempest's veil is drawn
Across the smiling face of dawn.
Alas! Tattiana fades away,
Grows pale and sinks, but nothing says;
Listless is she the livelong day
Nor interest in aught betrays.
Shaking with serious air the head,
In whispers low the neighbours said:
'Tis time she to the altar went!
But enough! Now, 'tis my intent
The imagination to enliven
With love which happiness extends;
Against my inclination, friends,
By sympathy I have been driven.
Forgive me! Such the love I bear
My heroine, Tattiana dear.
Vladimir, hourly more a slave
To youthful Olga's beauty bright,
Into delicious bondage gave
His ardent soul with full delight.
Always together, eventide
Found them in darkness side by side,
At morn, hand clasped in hand, they rove
Around the meadow and the grove.
And what resulted? Drunk with love,
But with confused and bashful air,
Lenski at intervals would dare,
If Olga smilingly approve,
Dally with a dishevelled tress
Or kiss the border of her dress.
To Olga frequently he would
Some nice instructive novel read,
Whose author nature understood
Better than Chateaubriand did
Yet sometimes pages two or three
(Nonsense and pure absurdity,
For maiden's hearing deemed unfit),
He somewhat blushing would omit:
Far from the rest the pair would creep
And (elbows on the table) they
A game of chess would often play,
Buried in meditation deep,
Till absently Vladimir took
With his own pawn alas! his rook!
Homeward returning, he at home
Is occupied with Olga fair,
An album, fly-leaf of the tome,
He leisurely adorns for her.
Landscapes thereon he would design,
A tombstone, Aphrodite's shrine,
Or, with a pen and colours fit,
A dove which on a lyre doth sit;
The "in memoriam” pages sought,
Where many another hand had signed
A tender couplet he combined,
A register of fleeting thought,
A flimsy trace of musings past
Which might for many ages last.
Surely ye all have overhauled
A country damsel's album trim,
Which all her darling friends have scrawled
From first to last page to the rim.
Behold! orthography despising,
Metreless verses recognizing
By friendship how they were abused,
Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
Upon the opening page ye find:
Qu'ecrirer-vouz sur ces tablettes?
Subscribed, toujours à vous, Annette;
And on the last one, underlined:
Who in thy love finds more delight
Beyond this may attempt to write.
Infallibly you there will find
Two hearts, a torch, of flowers a wreath,
And vows will probably be signed:
Affectionately yours till death.
Some army poet therein may
Have smuggled his flagitious lay.
In such an album with delight
I would, my friends, inscriptions write,
Because I should be sure, meanwhile,
My verses, kindly meant, would earn
Delighted glances in return;
That afterwards with evil smile
They would not solemnly debate
If cleverly or not I prate.
But, O ye tomes without compare,
Which from the devil's bookcase start,
Albums magnificent which scare
The fashionable rhymester's heart!
Yea! although rendered beauteous
By Tolstoy's pencil marvellous,
Though Baratynski verses penned,
The thunderbolt on you descend!
Whene'er a brilliant courtly dame
Presents her quarto amiably,
Despair and anger seize on me,
And a malicious epigram
Trembles upon my lips from spite,—
And madrigals I'm asked to write!
But Lenski madrigals ne'er wrote
In Olga's album, youthful maid,
To purest love he tuned his note
Nor frigid adulation paid.
What never was remarked or heard
Of Olga he in song averred;
His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
Both natural and truthful seemed.
Thus thou, Yazykoff, dost arise
In amorous flights when so inspired,
Singing God knows what maid admired,
And all thy precious elegies,
Sometime collected, shall relate
The story of thy life and fate.
Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
Incited by his stormy Muse
Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
But Olga would not such peruse.
When poets lachrymose recite
Beneath the eyes of ladies bright
Their own productions, some insist
No greater pleasure can exist
Just so! that modest swain is blest
Who reads his visionary theme
To the fair object of his dream,
A beauty languidly at rest,
Yes, happy—though she at his side
By other thoughts be occupied.
But I the products of my Muse,
Consisting of harmonious lays,
To my old nurse alone peruse,
Companion of my childhood's days.
Or, after dinner's dull repast,
I by the button-hole seize fast
My neighbour, who by chance drew near,
And breathe a drama in his ear.
Or else (I deal not here in jokes),
Exhausted by my woes and rhymes,
I sail upon my lake at times
And terrify a swarm of ducks,
Who, heard the music of my lay,
Take to their wings and fly away.
But to Onéguine! A propos!
Friends, I must your indulgence pray.
His daily occupations, lo!
Minutely I will now portray.
A hermit's life Onéguine led,
At seven in summer rose from bed,
And clad in airy costume took
His course unto the running brook.
There, aping Gulnare's bard, he spanned
His Hellespont from bank to bank,
And then a cup of coffee drank,
Some wretched journal in his hand;
Then dressed himself...
Sound sleep, books, walking, were his bliss,
The murmuring brook, the woodland shade,
The uncontaminated kiss
Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
A fiery, yet well-broken horse,
A dinner, whimsical each course,
A bottle of a vintage white
And solitude and calm delight.
Such was Onéguine's sainted life,
And such unconsciously he led,
Nor marked how summer's prime had fled
In aimless ease and far from strife,
The curse of commonplace delight.
And town and friends forgotten quite.
This northern summer of our own,
On winters of the south a skit,
Glimmers and dies. This is well known,
Though we will not acknowledge it.
Already Autumn chilled the sky,
The tiny sun shone less on high
And shorter had the days become.
The forests in mysterious gloom
Were stripped with melancholy sound,
Upon the earth a mist did lie
And many a caravan on high
Of clamorous geese flew southward bound.
A weary season was at hand—
November at the gate did stand.
The morn arises foggy, cold,
The silent fields no peasant nears,
The wolf upon the highways bold
With his ferocious mate appears.
Detecting him the passing horse
Snorts, and his rider bends his course
And wisely gallops to the hill.
No more at dawn the shepherd will
Drive out the cattle from their shed,
Nor at the hour of noon with sound
Of horn in circle call them round.
Singing inside her hut the maid
Spins, whilst the friend of wintry night,
The pine-torch, by her crackles bright.
Already crisp hoar frosts impose
O'er all a sheet of silvery dust
(Readers expect the rhyme of rose,
There! take it quickly, if ye must).
Behold! than polished floor more nice
The shining river clothed in ice;
A joyous troop of little boys
Engrave the ice with strident noise.
A heavy goose on scarlet feet,
Thinking to float upon the stream,
Descends the bank with care extreme,
But staggers, slips, and falls. We greet
The first bright wreathing storm of snow
Which falls in starry flakes below.
How in the country pass this time?
Walking? The landscape tires the eye
In winter by its blank and dim
And naked uniformity.
On horseback gallop o'er the steppe!
Your steed, though rough-shod, cannot keep
His footing on the treacherous rime
And may fall headlong any time.
Alone beneath your rooftree stay
And read De Pradt or Walter Scott!
Keep your accounts! You'd rather not?
Then get mad drunk or wroth; the day
Will pass; the same to-morrow try—
You'll spend your winter famously!
A true Childe Harold my Eugene
To idle musing was a prey;
At morn an icy bath within
He sat, and then the livelong day,
Alone within his habitation
And buried deep in meditation,
He round the billiard-table stalked,
The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
When evening o'er the landscape looms,
Billiards abandoned, cue forgot,
A table to the fire is brought,
And he waits dinner. Lenski comes,
Driving abreast three horses gray.
"Bring dinner now without delay!”
Upon the table in a trice
Of widow Clicquot or Moet
A blessed bottle, placed in ice,
For the young poet they display.
Like Hippocrene it scatters light,
Its ebullition foaming white
(Like other things I could relate)
My heart of old would captivate.
The last poor obol I was worth—
Was it not so?—for thee I gave,
And thy inebriating wave
Full many a foolish prank brought forth;
And oh! what verses, what delights,
Delicious visions, jests and fights!
Alas! my stomach it betrays
With its exhilarating flow,
And I confess that now-a-days
I prefer sensible Bordeaux.
To cope with Ay no more I dare,
For Ay is like a mistress fair,
Seductive, animated, bright,
But wilful, frivolous, and light.
But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend
Who in the agony of grief
Is ever ready with relief,
Assistance ever will extend,
Or quietly partake our woe.
All hail! my good old friend Bordeaux!
The fire sinks low. An ashy cloak
The golden ember now enshrines,
And barely visible the smoke
Upward in a thin stream inclines.
But little warmth the fireplace lends,
Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
The goblet still is bubbling bright—
Outside descend the mists of night.
How pleasantly the evening jogs
When o'er a glass with friends we prate
Just at the hour we designate
The time between the wolf and dogs—
I cannot tell on what pretence—
But lo! the friends to chat commence.
"How are our neighbours fair, pray tell,
Tattiana, saucy Olga thine?”—
"The family are all quite well—
Give me just half a glass of wine—
They sent their compliments—but oh!
How charming Olga's shoulders grow!
Her figure perfect grows with time!
She is an angel! We sometime
Must visit them. Come! you must own,
My friend, 'tis but to pay a debt,
For twice you came to them and yet
You never since your nose have shown.
But stay! A dolt am I who speak!
They have invited you this week.”
"Me?”—"Yes! It is Tattiana's fête
Next Saturday. The Làrina
Told me to ask you. Ere that date
Make up your mind to go there.”—"Ah!
It will be by a mob beset
Of every sort and every set!”—
"Not in the least, assured am I!”—
"Who will be there?”—"The family.
Do me a favour and appear.
Will you?”—"Agreed.”—"I thank you, friend,”
And saying this Vladimir drained
His cup unto his maiden dear.
Then touching Olga they depart
In fresh discourse. Such, love, thou art!
He was most gay. The happy date
In three weeks would arrive for them;
The secrets of the marriage state
And love's delicious diadem
With rapturous longing he awaits,
Nor in his dreams anticipates
Hymen's embarrassments, distress,
And freezing fits of weariness.
Though we, of Hymen foes, meanwhile,
In life domestic see a string
Of pictures painful harrowing,
A novel in Lafontaine's style,
My wretched Lenski's fate I mourn,
He seemed for matrimony born.
He was beloved: or say at least,
He thought so, and existence charmed.
The credulous indeed are blest,
And he who, jealousy disarmed,
In sensual sweets his soul doth steep
As drunken tramps at nightfall sleep,
Or, parable more flattering,
As butterflies to blossoms cling.
But wretched who anticipates,
Whose brain no fond illusions daze,
Who every gesture, every phrase
In true interpretation hates:
Whose heart experience icy made
And yet oblivion forbade.
That year the autumn season late
Kept lingering on as loath to go,
All Nature winter seemed to await,
Till January fell no snow—
The third at night. Tattiana wakes
Betimes, and sees, when morning breaks,
Park, garden, palings, yard below
And roofs near morn blanched o'er with snow;
Upon the windows tracery,
The trees in silvery array,
Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
And the far mountains daintily
O'erspread with Winter's carpet bright,
All so distinct, and all so white!
Winter! The peasant blithely goes
To labour in his sledge forgot,
His pony sniffing the fresh snows
Just manages a feeble trot
Though deep he sinks into the drift;
Forth the kibitka gallops swift,
Its driver seated on the rim
In scarlet sash and sheepskin trim;
Yonder the household lad doth run,
Placed in a sledge his terrier black,
Himself transformed into a hack;
To freeze his finger hath begun,
He laughs, although it aches from cold,
His mother from the door doth scold.
In scenes like these it may be though,
Ye feel but little interest,
They are all natural and low,
Are not with elegance impressed.
Another bard with art divine
Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
The first appearance of the snows
And all the joys which Winter knows.
He will delight you, I am sure,
When he in ardent verse portrays
Secret excursions made in sleighs;
But competition I abjure
Either with him or thee in song,
Bard of the Finnish maiden young.
Tattiana, Russian to the core,
Herself not knowing well the reason,
The Russian winter did adore
And the cold beauties of the season:
On sunny days the glistening rime,
Sledging, the snows, which at the time
Of sunset glow with rosy light,
The misty evenings ere Twelfth Night.
These evenings as in days of old
The Làrinas would celebrate,
The servants used to congregate
And the young ladies fortunes told,
And every year distributed
Journeys and warriors to wed.
Tattiana in traditions old
Believed, the people's wisdom weird,
In dreams and what the moon foretold
And what she from the cards inferred.
Omens inspired her soul with fear,
Mysteriously all objects near
A hidden meaning could impart,
Presentiments oppressed her heart.
Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
With one paw strokes her face and purrs,
Tattiana certainly infers
That guests approach: and when above
The new moon's crescent slim she spied,
Suddenly to the left hand side,
She trembled and grew deadly pale.
Or a swift meteor, may be,
Across the gloom of heaven would sail
And disappear in space; then she
Would haste in agitation dire
To mutter her concealed desire
Ere the bright messenger had set.
When in her walks abroad she met
A friar black approaching near,
Or a swift hare from mead to mead
Had run across her path at speed,
Wholly beside herself with fear,
Anticipating woe she pined,
Certain misfortune near opined.
Wherefore? She found a secret joy
In horror for itself alone,
Thus Nature doth our souls alloy,
Thus her perversity hath shown.
Twelfth Night approaches. Merry eves!
When thoughtless youth whom nothing grieves,
Before whose inexperienced sight
Life lies extended, vast and bright,
To peer into the future tries.
Old age through spectacles too peers,
Although the destined coffin nears,
Having lost all in life we prize.
It matters not. Hope e'en to these
With childlike lisp will lie to please.
Tattiana gazed with curious eye
On melted wax in water poured;
The clue unto some mystery
She deemed its outline might afford.
Rings from a dish of water full
In order due the maidens pull;
But when Tattiana's hand had ta'en
A ring she heard the ancient strain:
The peasants there are rich as kings,
They shovel silver with a spade,
He whom we sing to shall be made
Happy and glorious. But this brings
With sad refrain misfortune near.
Girls the kashourka much prefer.
Frosty the night; the heavens shone;
The wondrous host of heavenly spheres
Sailed silently in unison—
Tattiana in the yard appears
In a half-open dressing-gown
And bends her mirror on the moon,
But trembling on the mirror dark
The sad moon only could remark.
List! the snow crunches—he draws nigh!
The girl on tiptoe forward bounds
And her voice sweeter than the sounds
Of clarinet or flute doth cry:
"What is your name?” The boor looked dazed,
And "Agathon” replied, amazed.
Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
By night prepared for sorcery,
And in the bathroom did command
To lay two covers secretly.
But sudden fear assailed Tattiana,
And I, remembering Svetlana,
Become alarmed. So never mind!
I'm not for witchcraft now inclined.
So she her silken sash unlaced,
Undressed herself and went to bed
And soon Lel hovered o'er her head.
Beneath her downy pillow placed,
A little virgin mirror peeps.
'Tis silent all. Tattiana sleeps.
A dreadful sleep Tattiana sleeps.
She dreamt she journeyed o'er a field
All covered up with snow in heaps,
By melancholy fogs concealed.
Amid the snowdrifts which surround
A stream, by winter's ice unbound,
Impetuously clove its way
With boiling torrent dark and gray;
Two poles together glued by ice,
A fragile bridge and insecure,
Spanned the unbridled torrent o'er;
Beside the thundering abyss
Tattiana in despair unfeigned
Rooted unto the spot remained.
As if against obstruction sore
Tattiana o'er the stream complained;
To help her to the other shore
No one appeared to lend a hand.
But suddenly a snowdrift stirs,
And what from its recess appears?
A bristly bear of monstrous size!
He roars, and "Ah!” Tattiana cries.
He offers her his murderous paw;
She nerves herself from her alarm
And leans upon the monster's arm,
With footsteps tremulous with awe
Passes the torrent But alack!
Bruin is marching at her back!
She, to turn back her eyes afraid,
Accelerates her hasty pace,
But cannot anyhow evade
Her shaggy myrmidon in chase.
The bear rolls on with many a grunt:
A forest now she sees in front
With fir-trees standing motionless
In melancholy loveliness,
Their branches by the snow bowed down.
Through aspens, limes and birches bare,
The shining orbs of night appear;
There is no path; the storm hath strewn
Both bush and brake, ravine and steep,
And all in snow is buried deep.
The wood she enters—bear behind,—
In snow she sinks up to the knee;
Now a long branch itself entwined
Around her neck, now violently
Away her golden earrings tore;
Now the sweet little shoes she wore,
Grown clammy, stick fast in the snow;
Her handkerchief she loses now;
No time to pick it up! afraid,
She hears the bear behind her press,
Nor dares the skirting of her dress
For shame lift up the modest maid.
She runs, the bear upon her trail,
Until her powers of running fail.
She sank upon the snow. But Bruin
Adroitly seized and carried her;
Submissive as if in a swoon,
She cannot draw a breath or stir.
He dragged her by a forest road
Till amid trees a hovel showed,
By barren snow heaped up and bound,
A tangled wilderness around.
Bright blazed the window of the place,
Within resounded shriek and shout:
"My chum lives here,” Bruin grunts out.
"Warm yourself here a little space!”
Straight for the entrance then he made
And her upon the threshold laid.
Recovering, Tania gazes round;
Bear gone—she at the threshold placed;
Inside clink glasses, cries resound
As if it were some funeral feast.
But deeming all this nonsense pure,
She peeped through a chink of the door.
What doth she see? Around the board
Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
A canine face with horns thereon,
Another with cock's head appeared,
Here an old witch with hirsute beard,
There an imperious skeleton;
A dwarf adorned with tail, again
A shape half cat and half a crane.
Yet ghastlier, yet more wonderful,
A crab upon a spider rides,
Perched on a goose's neck a skull
In scarlet cap revolving glides.
A windmill too a jig performs
And wildly waves its arms and storms;
Barking, songs, whistling, laughter coarse,
The speech of man and tramp of horse.
But wide Tattiana oped her eyes
When in that company she saw
Him who inspired both love and awe,
The hero we immortalize.
Onéguine sat the table by
And viewed the door with cunning eye.
All bustle when he makes a sign:
He drinks, all drink and loudly call;
He smiles, in laughter all combine;
He knits his brows—'tis silent all.
He there is master—that is plain;
Tattiana courage doth regain
And grown more curious by far
Just placed the entrance door ajar.
The wind rose instantly, blew out
The fire of the nocturnal lights;
A trouble fell upon the sprites;
Onéguine lightning glances shot;
Furious he from the table rose;
All arise. To the door he goes.
Tattiana would attempt to fly,
Terror assails her. Hastily
She cannot—then impatiently
She strains her throat to force a cry—
She cannot—Eugene oped the door
And the young girl appeared before
Those hellish phantoms. Peals arise
Of frantic laughter, and all eyes
And hoofs and crooked snouts and paws,
Tails which a bushy tuft adorns,
Whiskers and bloody tongues and horns,
Sharp rows of tushes, bony claws,
Are turned upon her. All combine
In one great shout: she's mine! she's mine!
"Mine!” cried Eugene with savage tone.
The troop of apparitions fled,
And in the frosty night alone
Remained with him the youthful maid.
With tranquil air Onéguine leads
Tattiana to a corner, bids
Her on a shaky bench sit down;
His head sinks slowly, rests upon
Her shoulder—Olga swiftly came—
And Lenski followed—a light broke—
His fist Onéguine fiercely shook
And gazed around with eyes of flame;
The unbidden guests he roughly chides—
Tattiana motionless abides.
The strife grew furious and Eugene
Grasped a long knife and instantly
Struck Lenski dead—across the scene
Dark shadows thicken—a dread cry
Was uttered, and the cabin shook—
Tattiana terrified awoke.
She gazed around her—it was day.
Lo! through the frozen windows play
Aurora's ruddy rays of light—
The door flew open—Olga came,
More blooming than the Boreal flame
And swifter than the swallow's flight.
"Come,” she cried, "sister, tell me e'en
Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
But she, her sister never heeding,
With book in hand reclined in bed,
Page after page continued reading,
But no reply unto her made.
Although her book did not contain
The bard's enthusiastic strain,
Nor precepts sage nor pictures e'en,
Yet neither Virgil nor Racine
Nor Byron, Walter Scott, nor Seneca,
Nor the Journal des Modes, I vouch,
Ever absorbed a maid so much:
Its name, my friends, was Martin Zadeka,
The chief of the Chaldean wise,
Who dreams expound and prophecies.
Brought by a pedlar vagabond
Unto their solitude one day,
This monument of thought profound
Tattiana purchased with a stray
Tome of "Malvina,” and but three
And a half rubles down gave she;
Also, to equalise the scales,
She got a book of nursery tales,
A grammar, likewise Petriads two,
Marmontel also, tome the third;
Tattiana every day conferred
With Martin Zadeka. In woe
She consolation thence obtained—
Inseparable they remained.
The dream left terror in its train.
Not knowing its interpretation,
Tania the meaning would obtain
Of such a dread hallucination.
Tattiana to the index flies
And alphabetically tries
The words bear, bridge, fir, darkness, bog,
Raven, snowstorm, tempest, fog,
Et cetera; but nothing showed
Her Martin Zadeka in aid,
Though the foul vision promise made
Of a most mournful episode,
And many a day thereafter laid
A load of care upon the maid.
"But lo! forth from the valleys dun
With purple hand Aurora leads,
Swift following in her wake, the sun,”
And a grand festival proceeds.
The Làrinas were since sunrise
O'erwhelmed with guests; by families
The neighbours come, in sledge approach,
Britzka, kibitka, or in coach.
Crush and confusion in the hall,
Latest arrivals' salutations,
Barking, young ladies' osculations,
Shouts, laughter, jamming 'gainst the wall,
Bows and the scrape of many feet,
Nurses who scream and babes who bleat.
Bringing his partner corpulent
Fat Poustiakoff drove to the door;
Gvozdine, a landlord excellent,
Oppressor of the wretched poor;
And the Skatènines, aged pair,
With all their progeny were there,
Who from two years to thirty tell;
Pétòushkoff, the provincial swell;
Bouyànoff too, my cousin, wore
His wadded coat and cap with peak
(Surely you know him as I speak);
And Fliànoff, pensioned councillor,
Rogue and extortioner of yore,
Now buffoon, glutton, and a bore.
The family of Kharlikoff,
Came with Monsieur Triquet, a prig,
Who arrived lately from Tamboff,
In spectacles and chestnut wig.
Like a true Frenchman, couplets wrought
In Tania's praise in pouch he brought,
Known unto children perfectly:
Reveillez-vouz, belle endormie.
Among some ancient ballads thrust,
He found them in an almanac,
And the sagacious Triquet back
To light had brought them from their dust,
Whilst he "belle Nina” had the face
By "belle Tattiana” to replace.
Lo! from the nearest barrack came,
Of old maids the divinity,
And comfort of each country dame,
The captain of a company.
He enters. Ah! good news to-day!
The military band will play.
The colonel sent it. Oh! delight!
So there will be a dance to-night.
Girls in anticipation skip!
But dinner-time comes. Two and two
They hand in hand to table go.
The maids beside Tattiana keep—
Men opposite. The cross they sign
And chattering loud sit down to dine.
Ceased for a space all chattering.
Jaws are at work. On every side
Plates, knives and forks are clattering
And ringing wine-glasses are plied.
But by degrees the crowd begin
To raise a clamour and a din:
They laugh, they argue, and they bawl,
They shout and no one lists at all.
The doors swing open: Lenski makes
His entrance with Onéguine. "Ah!
At last the author!” cries Mamma.
The guests make room; aside each takes
His chair, plate, knife and fork in haste;
The friends are called and quickly placed.
Right opposite Tattiana placed,
She, than the morning moon more pale,
More timid than a doe long chased,
Lifts not her eyes which swimming fail.
Anew the flames of passion start
Within her; she is sick at heart;
The two friends' compliments she hears
Not, and a flood of bitter tears
With effort she restrains. Well nigh
The poor girl fell into a faint,
But strength of mind and self-restraint
Prevailed at last. She in reply
Said something in an undertone
And at the table sat her down.
To tragedy, the fainting fit,
And female tears hysterical,
Onéguine could not now submit,
For long he had endured them all.
Our misanthrope was full of ire,
At a great feast against desire,
And marking Tania's agitation,
Cast down his eyes in trepidation
And sulked in silent indignation;
Swearing how Lenski he would rile,
Avenge himself in proper style.
Triumphant by anticipation,
Caricatures he now designed
Of all the guests within his mind.
Certainly not Eugene alone
Tattiana's trouble might have spied,
But that the eyes of every one
By a rich pie were occupied—
Unhappily too salt by far;
And that a bottle sealed with tar
Appeared, Don's effervescing boast,
Between the blanc-mange and the roast;
Behind, of glasses an array,
Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
Zizi, thou mirror of my mind,
Fair object of my guileless lay,
Seductive cup of love, whose flow
Made me so tipsy long ago!
From the moist cork the bottle freed
With loud explosion, the bright wine
Hissed forth. With serious air indeed,
Long tortured by his lay divine,
Triquet arose, and for the bard
The company deep silence guard.
Tania well nigh expired when he
Turned to her and discordantly
Intoned it, manuscript in hand.
Voices and hands applaud, and she
Must bow in common courtesy;
The poet, modest though so grand,
Drank to her health in the first place,
Then handed her the song with grace.
Congratulations, toasts resound,
Tattiana thanks to all returned,
But, when Onéguine's turn came round,
The maiden's weary eye which yearned,
Her agitation and distress
Aroused in him some tenderness.
He bowed to her nor silence broke,
But somehow there shone in his look
The witching light of sympathy;
I know not if his heart felt pain
Or if he meant to flirt again,
From habit or maliciously,
But kindness from his eye had beamed
And to revive Tattiana seemed.
The chairs are thrust back with a roar,
The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
As bees who leave their dainty store
And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.
Contented and with victuals stored,
Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
Matrons unto the fireplace go,
Maids in the corner whisper low;
Behold! green tables are brought forth,
And testy gamesters do engage
In boston and the game of age,
Ombre, and whist all others worth:
A strong resemblance these possess—
All sons of mental weariness.
Eight rubbers were already played,
Eight times the heroes of the fight
Change of position had essayed,
When tea was brought. 'Tis my delight
Time to denote by dinner, tea,
And supper. In the country we
Can count the time without much fuss—
The stomach doth admonish us.
And, by the way, I here assert
That for that matter in my verse
As many dinners I rehearse,
As oft to meat and drink advert,
As thou, great Homer, didst of yore,
Whom thirty centuries adore.
I will with thy divinity
Contend with knife and fork and platter,
But grant with magnanimity
I'm beaten in another matter;
Thy heroes, sanguinary wights,
Also thy rough-and-tumble fights,
Thy Venus and thy Jupiter,
More advantageously appear
Than cold Onéguine's oddities,
The aspect of a landscape drear.
Or e'en Istomina, my dear,
And fashion's gay frivolities;
But my Tattiana, on my soul,
Is sweeter than thy Helen foul.
No one the contrary will urge,
Though for his Helen Menelaus
Again a century should scourge
Us, and like Trojan warriors slay us;
Though around honoured Priam's throne
Troy's sages should in concert own
Once more, when she appeared in sight,
Paris and Menelaus right.
But as to fighting—'twill appear!
For patience, reader, I must plead!
A little farther please to read
And be not in advance severe.
There'll be a fight. I do not lie.
My word of honour given have I.
The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
But scarce had maids their saucers ta'en
When in the grand saloon was heard
Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
His soul by crash of music fired,
His tea with rum no more desired,
The Paris of those country parts
To Olga Petoushkova darts:
To Tania Lenski; Kharlikova,
A marriageable maid matured,
The poet from Tamboff secured,
Bouyànoff whisked off Poustiakova.
All to the grand saloon are gone—
The ball in all its splendour shone.
I tried when I began this tale,
(See the first canto if ye will),
A ball in Peter's capital,
To sketch ye in Albano's style.
But by fantastic dreams distraught,
My memory wandered wide and sought
The feet of my dear lady friends.
O feet, where'er your path extends
I long enough deceived have erred.
The perfidies I recollect
Should make me much more circumspect,
Reform me both in deed and word,
And this fifth canto ought to be
From such digressions wholly free.
The whirlwind of the waltz sweeps by,
Undeviating and insane
As giddy youth's hilarity—
Pair after pair the race sustain.
The moment for revenge, meanwhile,
Espying, Eugene with a smile
Approaches Olga and the pair
Amid the company career.
Soon the maid on a chair he seats,
Begins to talk of this and that,
But when two minutes she had sat,
Again the giddy waltz repeats.
All are amazed; but Lenski he
Scarce credits what his eyes can see.
Hark! the mazurka. In times past,
When the mazurka used to peal,
All rattled in the ball-room vast,
The parquet cracked beneath the heel,
And jolting jarred the window-frames.
'Tis not so now. Like gentle dames
We glide along a floor of wax.
However, the mazurka lacks
Nought of its charms original
In country towns, where still it keeps
Its stamping, capers and high leaps.
Fashion is there immutable,
Who tyrannizes us with ease,
Of modern Russians the disease.
Bouyànoff, wrathful cousin mine,
Unto the hero of this lay
Olga and Tania led. Malign,
Onéguine Olga bore away.
Gliding in negligent career,
He bending whispered in her ear
Some madrigal not worth a rush,
And pressed her hand—the crimson blush
Upon her cheek by adulation
Grew brighter still. But Lenski hath
Seen all, beside himself with wrath,
And hot with jealous indignation,
Till the mazurka's close he stays,
Her hand for the cotillon prays.
She fears she cannot.—Cannot? Why?—
She promised Eugene, or she would
With great delight.—O God on high!
Heard he the truth? And thus she could—
And can it be? But late a child
And now a fickle flirt and wild,
Cunning already to display
And well-instructed to betray!
Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
At womankind he growled a curse,
Departed, ordered out his horse
And galloped home. But pistols twain,
A pair of bullets—nought beside—
His fate shall presently decide.
Having remarked Vladimir's flight,
Onéguine, bored to death again,
By Olga stood, dejected quite
And satisfied with vengeance ta'en.
Olga began to long likewise
For Lenski, sought him with her eyes,
And endless the cotillon seemed
As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
'Tis done. To supper they proceed.
Bedding is laid out and to all
Assigned a lodging, from the hall
Up to the attic, and all need
Tranquil repose. Eugene alone
To pass the night at home hath gone.
All slumber. In the drawing-room
Loud snores the cumbrous Poustiakoff
With better half as cumbersome;
Gvozdine, Bouyànoff, Pétòushkoff
And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
On chairs in the saloon reposed,
Whilst on the floor Monsieur Triquet
In jersey and in nightcap lay.
In Olga's and Tattiana's rooms
Lay all the girls by sleep embraced,
Except one by the window placed
Whom pale Diana's ray illumes—
My poor Tattiana cannot sleep
But stares into the darkness deep.
His visit she had not awaited,
His momentary loving glance
Her inmost soul had penetrated,
And his strange conduct at the dance
With Olga; nor of this appeared
An explanation: she was scared,
Alarmed by jealous agonies:
A hand of ice appeared to seize
Her heart: it seemed a darksome pit
Beneath her roaring opened wide:
"I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
"But death from him will be delight.
I murmur not! Why mournfulness?
He cannot give me happiness.”
Haste, haste thy lagging pace, my story!
A new acquaintance we must scan.
There dwells five versts from Krasnogory,
Vladimir's property, a man
Who thrives this moment as I write,
A philosophic anchorite:
Zaretski, once a bully bold,
A gambling troop when he controlled,
Chief rascal, pot-house president,
Now of a family the head,
Simple and kindly and unwed,
True friend, landlord benevolent,
Yea! and a man of honour, lo!
How perfect doth our epoch grow!
Time was the flattering voice of fame,
His ruffian bravery adored,
And true, his pistol's faultless aim
An ace at fifteen paces bored.
But I must add to what I write
That, tipsy once in actual fight,
He from his Kalmuck horse did leap
In mud and mire to wallow deep,
Drunk as a fly; and thus the French
A valuable hostage gained,
A modern Regulus unchained,
Who to surrender did not blench
That every morn at Verrey's cost
Three flasks of wine he might exhaust.
Time was, his raillery was gay,
He loved the simpleton to mock,
To make wise men the idiot play
Openly or 'neath decent cloak.
Yet sometimes this or that deceit
Encountered punishment complete,
And sometimes into snares as well
Himself just like a greenhorn fell.
He could in disputation shine
With pungent or obtuse retort,
At times to silence would resort,
At times talk nonsense with design;
Quarrels among young friends he bred
And to the field of honour led;
Or reconciled them, it may be,
And all the three to breakfast went;
Then he'd malign them secretly
With jest and gossip gaily blent.
Sed alia tempora. And bravery
(Like love, another sort of knavery!)
Diminishes as years decline.
But, as I said, Zaretski mine
Beneath acacias, cherry-trees,
From storms protection having sought,
Lived as a really wise man ought,
Like Horace, planted cabbages,
Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
And lessons to his children read.
He was no fool, and Eugene mine,
To friendship making no pretence,
Admired his judgment, which was fine,
Pervaded with much common sense.
He usually was glad to see
The man and liked his company,
So, when he came next day to call,
Was not surprised thereby at all.
But, after mutual compliments,
Zaretski with a knowing grin,
Ere conversation could begin,
The epistle from the bard presents.
Onéguine to the window went
And scanned in silence its content.
It was a cheery, generous
Cartel, or challenge to a fight,
Whereto in language courteous
Lenski his comrade did invite.
Onéguine, by first impulse moved,
Turned and replied as it behoved,
Curtly announcing for the fray
That he was "ready any day.”
Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
He cared no longer there to stay,
Had much to do at home that day,
And so departed. But Eugene,
The matter by his conscience tried,
Was with himself dissatisfied.
In fact, the subject analysed,
Within that secret court discussed,
In much his conduct stigmatized;
For, from the outset, 'twas unjust
To jest as he had done last eve,
A timid, shrinking love to grieve.
And ought he not to disregard
The poet's madness? for 'tis hard
At eighteen not to play the fool!
Sincerely loving him, Eugene
Assuredly should not have been
Conventionality's dull tool—
Not a mere hot, pugnacious boy,
But man of sense and probity.
He might his motives have narrated,
Not bristled up like a wild beast,
He ought to have conciliated
That youthful heart—"But, now at least,
The opportunity is flown.
Besides, a duellist well-known
Hath mixed himself in the affair,
Malicious and a slanderer.
Undoubtedly, disdain alone
Should recompense his idle jeers,
But fools—their calumnies and sneers”—
Behold! the world's opinion!
Our idol, Honour's motive force,
Round which revolves the universe.
Impatient, boiling o'er with wrath,
The bard his answer waits at home,
But lo! his braggart neighbour hath
Triumphant with the answer come.
Now for the jealous youth what joy!
He feared the criminal might try
To treat the matter as a jest,
Use subterfuge, and thus his breast
From the dread pistol turn away.
But now all doubt was set aside,
Unto the windmill he must ride
To-morrow before break of day,
To cock the pistol; barrel bend
On thigh or temple, friend on friend.
Resolved the flirt to cast away,
The foaming Lenski would refuse,
To see his Olga ere the fray—
His watch, the sun in turn he views—
Finally tost his arms in air
And lo! he is already there!
He deemed his coming would inspire
Olga with trepidation dire.
He was deceived. Just as before
The miserable bard to meet,
As hope uncertain and as sweet,
Olga ran skipping from the door.
She was as heedless and as gay—
Well! just as she was yesterday.
"Why did you leave last night so soon?”
Was the first question Olga made,
Lenski, into confusion thrown,
All silently hung down his head.
Jealousy and vexation took
To flight before her radiant look,
Before such fond simplicity
And mental elasticity.
He eyed her with a fond concern,
Perceived that he was still beloved,
Already by repentance moved
To ask forgiveness seemed to yearn;
But trembles, words he cannot find,
Delighted, almost sane in mind.
But once more pensive and distressed
Beside his Olga doth he grieve,
Nor enough strength of mind possessed
To mention the foregoing eve,
He mused: "I will her saviour be!
With ardent sighs and flattery
The vile seducer shall not dare
The freshness of her heart impair,
Nor shall the caterpillar come
The lily's stem to eat away,
Nor shall the bud of yesterday
Perish when half disclosed its bloom!”—
All this, my friends, translate aright:
"I with my friend intend to fight!”
If he had only known the wound
Which rankled in Tattiana's breast,
And if Tattiana mine had found—
If the poor maiden could have guessed
That the two friends with morning's light
Above the yawning grave would fight,—
Ah! it may be, affection true
Had reconciled the pair anew!
But of this love, e'en casually,
As yet none had discovered aught;
Eugene of course related nought,
Tattiana suffered secretly;
Her nurse, who could have made a guess,
Was famous for thick-headedness.
Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
Now gloomy seemed and cheerful now,
But he who by the Muse was nursed
Is ever thus. With frowning brow
To the pianoforte he moves
And various chords upon it proves,
Then, eyeing Olga, whispers low:
"I'm happy, say, is it not so?”—
But it grew late; he must not stay;
Heavy his heart with anguish grew;
To the young girl he said adieu,
As it were, tore himself away.
Gazing into his face, she said:
"What ails thee?”—"Nothing.”—He is fled.
At home arriving he addressed
His care unto his pistols' plight,
Replaced them in their box, undressed
And Schiller read by candlelight.
But one thought only filled his mind,
His mournful heart no peace could find,
Olga he sees before his eyes
Miraculously fair arise,
Vladimir closes up his book,
And grasps a pen: his verse, albeit
With lovers' rubbish filled, was neat
And flowed harmoniously. He took
And spouted it with lyric fire—
Like D[elvig] when dinner doth inspire.
Destiny hath preserved his lay.
I have it. Lo! the very thing!
"Oh! whither have ye winged your way,
Ye golden days of my young spring?
What will the coming dawn reveal?
In vain my anxious eyes appeal;
In mist profound all yet is hid.
So be it! Just the laws which bid
The fatal bullet penetrate,
Or innocently past me fly.
Good governs all! The hour draws nigh
Of life or death predestinate.
Blest be the labours of the light,
And blest the shadows of the night.
"To-morrow's dawn will glimmer gray,
Bright day will then begin to burn,
But the dark sepulchre I may
Have entered never to return.
The memory of the bard, a dream,
Will be absorbed by Lethe's stream;
Men will forget me, but my urn
To visit, lovely maid, return,
O'er my remains to drop a tear,
And think: here lies who loved me well,
For consecrate to me he fell
In the dawn of existence drear.
Maid whom my heart desires alone,
Approach, approach; I am thine own.”
Thus in a style obscure and stale,
He wrote ('tis the romantic style,
Though of romance therein I fail
To see aught—never mind meanwhile)
And about dawn upon his breast
His weary head declined at rest,
For o'er a word to fashion known,
"Ideal,” he had drowsy grown.
But scarce had sleep's soft witchery
Subdued him, when his neighbour stept
Into the chamber where he slept
And wakened him with the loud cry:
"'Tis time to get up! Seven doth strike.
Onéguine waits on us, 'tis like.”
He was in error; for Eugene
Was sleeping then a sleep like death;
The pall of night was growing thin,
To Lucifer the cock must breathe
His song, when still he slumbered deep,
The sun had mounted high his steep,
A passing snowstorm wreathed away
With pallid light, but Eugene lay
Upon his couch insensibly;
Slumber still o'er him lingering flies.
But finally he oped his eyes
And turned aside the drapery;
He gazed upon the clock which showed
He long should have been on the road.
He rings in haste; in haste arrives
His Frenchman, good Monsieur Guillot,
Who dressing-gown and slippers gives
And linen on him doth bestow.
Dressing as quickly as he can,
Eugene directs the trusty man
To accompany him and to escort
A box of terrible import.
Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
He enters: to the mill he drives:
Descends, the order Guillot gives,
The fatal tubes Lepage contrived
To bring behind: the triple steeds
To two young oaks the coachman leads.
Lenski the foeman's apparition
Leaning against the dam expects,
Zaretski, village mechanician,
In the meantime the mill inspects.
Onéguine his excuses says;
"But,” cried Zaretski in amaze,
"Your second you have left behind!”
A duellist of classic mind,
Method was dear unto his heart
He would not that a man ye slay
In a lax or informal way,
But followed the strict rules of art,
And ancient usages observed
(For which our praise he hath deserved).
"My second!” cried in turn Eugene,
"Behold my friend Monsieur Guillot;
To this arrangement can be seen,
No obstacle of which I know.
Although unknown to fame mayhap,
He's a straightforward little chap.”
Zaretski bit his lip in wrath,
But to Vladimir Eugene saith:
"Shall we commence?”—"Let it be so,”
Lenski replied, and soon they be
Behind the mill. Meantime ye see
Zaretski and Monsieur Guillot
In consultation stand aside—
The foes with downcast eyes abide.
Foes! Is it long since friendship rent
Asunder was and hate prepared?
Since leisure was together spent,
Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
Now, like hereditary foes,
Malignant fury they disclose,
As in some frenzied dream of fear
These friends cold-bloodedly draw near
Mutual destruction to contrive.
Cannot they amicably smile
Ere crimson stains their hands defile,
Depart in peace and friendly live?
But fashionable hatred's flame
Trembles at artificial shame.
The shining pistols are uncased,
The mallet loud the ramrod strikes,
Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
For the first time the hammer clicks.
Lo! poured in a thin gray cascade,
The powder in the pan is laid,
The sharp flint, screwed securely on,
Is cocked once more. Uneasy grown,
Guillot behind a pollard stood;
Aside the foes their mantles threw,
Zaretski paces thirty-two
Measured with great exactitude.
At each extreme one takes his stand,
A loaded pistol in his hand.
"Advance!”—Indifferent and sedate,
The foes, as yet not taking aim,
With measured step and even gait
Athwart the snow four paces came—
Four deadly paces do they span;
Onéguine slowly then began
To raise his pistol to his eye,
Though he advanced unceasingly.
And lo! five paces more they pass,
And Lenski, closing his left eye,
Took aim—but as immediately
Onéguine fired—Alas! alas!
The poet's hour hath sounded—See!
He drops his pistol silently.
He on his bosom gently placed
His hand, and fell. His clouded eye
Not agony, but death expressed.
So from the mountain lazily
The avalanche of snow first bends,
Then glittering in the sun descends.
The cold sweat bursting from his brow,
To the youth Eugene hurried now—
Gazed on him, called him. Useless care!
He was no more! The youthful bard
For evermore had disappeared.
The storm was hushed. The blossom fair
Was withered ere the morning light—
The altar flame was quenched in night.
Tranquil he lay, and strange to view
The peace which on his forehead beamed,
His breast was riddled through and through,
The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
Ere this but one brief moment beat
That heart with inspiration sweet
And enmity and hope and love—
The blood boiled and the passions strove.
Now, as in a deserted house,
All dark and silent hath become;
The inmate is for ever dumb,
The windows whitened, shutters close—
Whither departed is the host?
God knows! The very trace is lost.
'Tis sweet the foe to aggravate
With epigrams impertinent,
Sweet to behold him obstinate,
His butting horns in anger bent,
The glass unwittingly inspect
And blush to own himself reflect.
Sweeter it is, my friends, if he
Howl like a dolt: 'tis meant for me!
But sweeter still it is to arrange
For him an honourable grave,
At his pale brow a shot to have,
Placed at the customary range;
But home his body to despatch
Can scarce in sweetness be a match.
Well, if your pistol ball by chance
The comrade of your youth should strike,
Who by a haughty word or glance
Or any trifle else ye like
You o'er your wine insulted hath—
Or even overcome by wrath
Scornfully challenged you afield—
Tell me, of sentiments concealed
Which in your spirit dominates,
When motionless your gaze beneath
He lies, upon his forehead death,
And slowly life coagulates—
When deaf and silent he doth lie
Heedless of your despairing cry?
Eugene, his pistol yet in hand
And with remorseful anguish filled,
Gazing on Lenski's corse did stand—
Zaretski shouted: "Why, he's killed!”—
Killed! at this dreadful exclamation
Onéguine went with trepidation
And the attendants called in haste.
Most carefully Zaretski placed
Within his sledge the stiffened corse,
And hurried home his awful freight.
Conscious of death approximate,
Loud paws the earth each panting horse,
His bit with foam besprinkled o'er,
And homeward like an arrow tore.
My friends, the poet ye regret!
When hope's delightful flower but bloomed
In bud of promise incomplete,
The manly toga scarce assumed,
He perished. Where his troubled dreams,
And where the admirable streams
Of youthful impulse, reverie,
Tender and elevated, free?
And where tempestuous love's desires,
The thirst of knowledge and of fame,
Horror of sinfulness and shame,
Imagination's sacred fires,
Ye shadows of a life more high,
Ye dreams of heavenly poesy?
Perchance to benefit mankind,
Or but for fame he saw the light;
His lyre, to silence now consigned,
Resounding through all ages might
Have echoed to eternity.
With worldly honours, it may be,
Fortune the poet had repaid.
It may be that his martyred shade
Carried a truth divine away;
That, for the century designed,
Had perished a creative mind,
And past the threshold of decay,
He ne'er shall hear Time's eulogy,
The blessings of humanity.
Or, it may be, the bard had passed
A life in common with the rest;
Vanished his youthful years at last,
The fire extinguished in his breast,
In many things had changed his life—
The Muse abandoned, ta'en a wife,
Inhabited the country, clad
In dressing-gown, a cuckold glad:
A life of fact, not fiction, led—
At forty suffered from the gout,
Eaten, drunk, gossiped and grown stout:
And finally, upon his bed
Had finished life amid his sons,
Doctors and women, sobs and groans.
But, howsoe'er his lot were cast,
Alas! the youthful lover slain,
Poetical enthusiast,
A friendly hand thy life hath ta'en!
There is a spot the village near
Where dwelt the Muses' worshipper,
Two pines have joined their tangled roots,
A rivulet beneath them shoots
Its waters to the neighbouring vale.
There the tired ploughman loves to lie,
The reaping girls approach and ply
Within its wave the sounding pail,
And by that shady rivulet
A simple tombstone hath been set.
There, when the rains of spring we mark
Upon the meadows showering,
The shepherd plaits his shoe of bark,
Of Volga fishermen doth sing,
And the young damsel from the town,
For summer to the country flown,
Whene'er across the plain at speed
Alone she gallops on her steed,
Stops at the tomb in passing by;
The tightened leathern rein she draws,
Aside she casts her veil of gauze
And reads with rapid eager eye
The simple epitaph—a tear
Doth in her gentle eye appear.
And meditative from the spot
She leisurely away doth ride,
Spite of herself with Lenski's lot
Longtime her mind is occupied.
She muses: "What was Olga's fate?
Longtime was her heart desolate
Or did her tears soon cease to flow?
And where may be her sister now?
Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
Of fashionable dames the foe,
The misanthrope of gloomy brow,
By whom the youthful bard was slain?”—
In time I'll give ye without fail
A true account and in detail.
But not at present, though sincerely
I on my chosen hero dote;
Though I'll return to him right early,
Just at this moment I cannot.
Years have inclined me to stern prose,
Years to light rhyme themselves oppose,
And now, I mournfully confess,
In rhyming I show laziness.
As once, to fill the rapid page
My pen no longer finds delight,
Other and colder thoughts affright,
Sterner solicitudes engage,
In worldly din or solitude
Upon my visions such intrude.
Fresh aspirations I have known,
I am acquainted with fresh care,
Hopeless are all the first, I own,
Yet still remains the old despair.
Illusions, dream, where, where your sweetness?
Where youth (the proper rhyme is fleetness)?
And is it true her garland bright
At last is shrunk and withered quite?
And is it true and not a jest,
Not even a poetic phrase,
That vanished are my youthful days
(This joking I used to protest),
Never for me to reappear—
That soon I reach my thirtieth year?
And so my noon hath come! If so,
I must resign myself, in sooth;
Yet let us part in friendship, O
My frivolous and jolly youth.
I thank thee for thy joyfulness,
Love's tender transports and distress,
For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
And all that from thy hand proceeds—
I thank thee. In thy company,
With tumult or contentment still
Of thy delights I drank my fill,
Enough! with tranquil spirit I
Commence a new career in life
And rest from bygone days of strife.
But pause! Thou calm retreats, farewell,
Where my days in the wilderness
Of languor and of love did tell
And contemplative dreaminess;
And thou, youth's early inspiration,
Invigorate imagination
And spur my spirit's torpid mood!
Fly frequent to my solitude,
Let not the poet's spirit freeze,
Grow harsh and cruel, dead and dry,
Eventually petrify
In the world's mortal revelries,
Amid the soulless sons of pride
And glittering simpletons beside;
Amid sly, pusillanimous
Spoiled children most degenerate
And tiresome rogues ridiculous
And stupid censors passionate;
Amid coquettes who pray to God
And abject slaves who kiss the rod;
In haunts of fashion where each day
All with urbanity betray,
Where harsh frivolity proclaims
Its cold unfeeling sentences;
Amid the awful emptiness
Of conversation, thought and aims—
In that morass where you and I
Wallow, my friends, in company!
Impelled by Spring's dissolving beams,
The snows from off the hills around
Descended swift in turbid streams
And flooded all the level ground.
A smile from slumbering nature clear
Did seem to greet the youthful year;
The heavens shone in deeper blue,
The woods, still naked to the view,
Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
The bee forth from his cell of wax
Flew to collect his rural tax;
The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
Herds low, and under night's dark veil
Already sings the nightingale.
Mournful is thine approach to me,
O Spring, thou chosen time of love!
What agitation languidly
My spirit and my blood doth move,
What sad emotions o'er me steal
When first upon my cheek I feel
The breath of Spring again renewed,
Secure in rural quietude—
Or, strange to me is happiness?
Do all things which to mirth incline.
And make a dark existence shine
Inflict annoyance and distress
Upon a soul inert and cloyed?—
And is all light within destroyed?
Or, heedless of the leaves' return
Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
Do we alone our losses mourn
Of which the rustling woods remind?
Or, when anew all Nature teems,
Do we foresee in troubled dreams
The coming of life's Autumn drear.
For which no springtime shall appear?
Or, it may be, we inly seek,
Wafted upon poetic wing,
Some other long-departed Spring,
Whose memories make the heart beat quick
With thoughts of a far distant land,
Of a strange night when the moon and—
'Tis now the season! Idlers all,
Epicurean philosophers,
Ye men of fashion cynical,
Of Levshin's school ye followers,
Priams of country populations
And dames of fine organisations,
Spring summons you to her green bowers,
'Tis the warm time of labour, flowers;
The time for mystic strolls which late
Into the starry night extend.
Quick to the country let us wend
In vehicles surcharged with freight;
In coach or post-cart duly placed
Beyond the city-barriers haste.
Thou also, reader generous,
The chaise long ordered please employ,
Abandon cities riotous,
Which in the winter were a joy:
The Muse capricious let us coax,
Go hear the rustling of the oaks
Beside a nameless rivulet,
Where in the country Eugene yet,
An idle anchorite and sad,
A while ago the winter spent,
Near young Tattiana resident,
My pretty self-deceiving maid—
No more the village knows his face,
For there he left a mournful trace.
Let us proceed unto a rill,
Which in a hilly neighbourhood
Seeks, winding amid meadows still,
The river through the linden wood.
The nightingale there all night long,
Spring's paramour, pours forth her song
The fountain brawls, sweetbriers bloom,
And lo! where lies a marble tomb
And two old pines their branches spread—
"Vladimir Lenski lies beneath,
Who early died a gallant death,”
Thereon the passing traveller read:
"The date, his fleeting years how long—
Repose in peace, thou child of song.”
Time was, the breath of early dawn
Would agitate a mystic wreath
Hung on a pine branch earthward drawn
Above the humble urn of death.
Time was, two maidens from their home
At eventide would hither come,
And, by the light the moonbeams gave,
Lament, embrace upon that grave.
But now—none heeds the monument
Of woe: effaced the pathway now:
There is no wreath upon the bough:
Alone beside it, gray and bent,
As formerly the shepherd sits
And his poor basten sandal knits.
My poor Vladimir, bitter tears
Thee but a little space bewept,
Faithless, alas! thy maid appears,
Nor true unto her sorrow kept.
Another could her heart engage,
Another could her woe assuage
By flattery and lover's art—
A lancer captivates her heart!
A lancer her soul dotes upon:
Before the altar, lo! the pair,
Mark ye with what a modest air
She bows her head beneath the crown;
Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
Her lips where light smiles come and go!
My poor Vladimir! In the tomb,
Passed into dull eternity,
Was the sad poet filled with gloom,
Hearing the fatal perfidy?
Or, beyond Lethe lulled to rest,
Hath the bard, by indifference blest,
Callous to all on earth become—
Is the world to him sealed and dumb?
The same unmoved oblivion
On us beyond the grave attends,
The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
Whilst struggling for the heritage.
Soon Olga's accents shrill resound
No longer through her former home;
The lancer, to his calling bound,
Back to his regiment must roam.
The aged mother, bathed in tears,
Distracted by her grief appears
When the hour came to bid good-bye—
But my Tattiana's eyes were dry.
Only her countenance assumed
A deadly pallor, air distressed;
When all around the entrance pressed,
To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
Around the carriage of the pair—
Tattiana gently led them there.
And long her eyes as through a haze
After the wedded couple strain;
Alas! the friend of childish days
Away, Tattiana, hath been ta'en.
Thy dove, thy darling little pet
On whom a sister's heart was set
Afar is borne by cruel fate,
For evermore is separate.
She wanders aimless as a sprite,
Into the tangled garden goes
But nowhere can she find repose,
Nor even tears afford respite,
Of consolation all bereft—
Well nigh her heart in twain was cleft.
In cruel solitude each day
With flame more ardent passion burns,
And to Onéguine far away
Her heart importunately turns.
She never more his face may view,
For was it not her duty to
Detest him for a brother slain?
The poet fell; already men
No more remembered him; unto
Another his betrothed was given;
The memory of the bard was driven
Like smoke athwart the heaven blue;
Two hearts perchance were desolate
And mourned him still. Why mourn his fate?
'Twas eve. 'Twas dusk. The river speeds
In tranquil flow. The beetle hums.
Already dance to song proceeds;
The fisher's fire afar illumes
The river's bank. Tattiana lone
Beneath the silver of the moon
Long time in meditation deep
Her path across the plain doth keep—
Proceeds, until she from a hill
Sees where a noble mansion stood,
A village and beneath, a wood,
A garden by a shining rill.
She gazed thereon, and instant beat
Her heart more loudly and more fleet.
She hesitates, in doubt is thrown—
"Shall I proceed, or homeward flee?
He is not there: I am not known:
The house and garden I would see.”
Tattiana from the hill descends
With bated breath, around she bends
A countenance perplexed and scared.
She enters a deserted yard—
Yelping, a pack of dogs rush out,
But at her shriek ran forth with noise
The household troop of little boys,
Who with a scuffle and a shout
The curs away to kennel chase,
The damsel under escort place.
"Can I inspect the mansion, please?”
Tattiana asks, and hurriedly
Unto Anicia for the keys
The family of children hie.
Anicia soon appears, the door
Opens unto her visitor.
Into the lonely house she went,
Wherein a space Onéguine spent.
She gazed—a cue, forgotten long,
Doth on the billiard table rest,
Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
A riding whip. She strolls along.
The beldam saith: "The hearth, by it
The master always used to sit.
"Departed Lenski here to dine
In winter time would often come.
Please follow this way, lady mine,
This is my master's sitting-room.
'Tis here he slept, his coffee took,
Into accounts would sometimes look,
A book at early morn perused.
The room my former master used.
On Sundays by yon window he,
Spectacles upon nose, all day
Was wont with me at cards to play.
God save his soul eternally
And grant his weary bones their rest
Deep in our mother Earth's chill breast!”
Tattiana's eyes with tender gleam
On everything around her gaze,
Of priceless value all things seem
And in her languid bosom raise
A pleasure though with sorrow knit:
The table with its lamp unlit,
The pile of books, with carpet spread
Beneath the window-sill his bed,
The landscape which the moonbeams fret,
The twilight pale which softens all,
Lord Byron's portrait on the wall
And the cast-iron statuette
With folded arms and eyes bent low,
Cocked hat and melancholy brow.
Long in this fashionable cell
Tattiana as enchanted stood;
But it grew late; cold blew the gale;
Dark was the valley and the wood
Slept o'er the river misty grown.
Behind the mountain sank the moon.
Long, long the hour had past when home
Our youthful wanderer should roam.
She hid the trouble of her breast,
Heaved an involuntary sigh
And turned to leave immediately,
But first permission did request
Thither in future to proceed
That certain volumes she might read.
Adieu she to the matron said
At the front gates, but in brief space
At early morn returns the maid
To the abandoned dwelling-place.
When in the study's calm retreat,
Wrapt in oblivion complete,
She found herself alone at last,
Longtime her tears flowed thick and fast;
But presently she tried to read;
At first for books was disinclined,
But soon their choice seemed to her mind
Remarkable. She then indeed
Devoured them with an eager zest.
A new world was made manifest!
Although we know that Eugene had
Long ceased to be a reading man,
Still certain authors, I may add,
He had excepted from the ban:
The bard of Juan and the Giaour,
With it may be a couple more;
Romances three, in which ye scan
Portrayed contemporary man
As the reflection of his age,
His immorality of mind
To arid selfishness resigned,
A visionary personage
With his exasperated sense,
His energy and impotence.
And numerous pages had preserved
The sharp incisions of his nail,
And these the attentive maid observed
With eye precise and without fail.
Tattiana saw with trepidation
By what idea or observation
Onéguine was the most impressed,
In what he merely acquiesced.
Upon those margins she perceived
Onéguine's pencillings. His mind
Made revelations undesigned,
Of what he thought and what believed,
A dagger, asterisk, or note
Interrogation to denote.
And my Tattiana now began
To understand by slow degrees
More clearly, God be praised, the man,
Whom autocratic fate's decrees
Had bid her sigh for without hope—
A dangerous, gloomy misanthrope,
Being from hell or heaven sent,
Angel or fiend malevolent.
Which is he? or an imitation,
A bogy conjured up in joke,
A Russian in Childe Harold's cloak,
Of foreign whims the impersonation—
Handbook of fashionable phrase
Or parody of modern ways?
Hath she found out the riddle yet?
Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
But time flies and she doth forget
They long at home have her expected—
Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
And a long time about her talked.
"What can be done? She is no child!”
Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
"Olinka is her junior, see.
'Tis time to marry her, 'tis true,
But tell me what am I to do?
To all she answers cruelly—
I will not wed, and ever weeps
And lonely through the forest creeps.”
"Is she in love?” quoth one. "With whom?
Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
Pétòushkoff met the selfsame doom.
The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
How the young imp on Tania doted!
To captivate her how devoted!
I mused: perhaps the matter's squared—
O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
"But, mátushka, to Moscow you
Should go, the market for a maid,
With many a vacancy, 'tis said.”—
"Alas! my friend, no revenue!”
"Enough to see one winter's end;
If not, the money I will lend.”
The venerable dame opined
The counsel good and full of reason,
Her money counted, and designed
To visit Moscow in the season.
Tattiana learns the intelligence—
Of her provincial innocence
The unaffected traits she now
Unto a carping world must show—
Her toilette's antiquated style,
Her antiquated mode of speech,
For Moscow fops and Circes each
To mark with a contemptuous smile.
Horror! had she not better stay
Deep in the greenwood far away?
Arising with the morning's light,
Unto the fields she makes her way,
And with emotional delight
Surveying them, she thus doth say:
"Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
Ye well-known mountain summits high,
Ye groves whose depths I know so well,
Thou beauteous sky above, farewell!
Delicious nature, thee I fly,
The calm existence which I prize
I yield for splendid vanities,
Thou too farewell, my liberty!
Whither and wherefore do I speed
And what will Destiny concede?”
Farther Tattiana's walks extend—
'Tis now the hillock now the rill
Their natural attractions lend
To stay the maid against her will.
She the acquaintances she loves,
Her spacious fields and shady groves,
Another visit hastes to pay.
But Summer swiftly fades away
And golden Autumn draweth nigh,
And pallid nature trembling grieves,
A victim decked with golden leaves;
Dark clouds before the north wind fly;
It blew: it howled: till winter e'en
Came forth in all her magic sheen.
The snow descends and buries all,
Hangs heavy on the oaken boughs,
A white and undulating pall
O'er hillock and o'er meadow throws.
The channel of the river stilled
As if with eider-down is filled.
The hoar-frost glitters: all rejoice
In mother Winter's strange caprice.
But Tania's heart is not at ease,
Winter's approach she doth not hail
Nor the frost particles inhale
Nor the first snow of winter seize
Her shoulders, breast and face to lave—
Alarm the winter journey gave.
The date was fixed though oft postponed,
But ultimately doth approach.
Examined, mended, newly found
Was the old and forgotten coach;
Kibitkas three, the accustomed train,
The household property contain:
Saucepans and mattresses and chairs,
Portmanteaus and preserves in jars,
Feather-beds, also poultry-coops,
Basins and jugs—well! everything
To happiness contributing.
Behold! beside their dwelling groups
Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
These to the coach of state are bound,
Breakfast the busy cooks prepare,
Baggage is heaped up in a mound,
Old women at the coachmen swear.
A bearded postillion astride
A lean and shaggy nag doth ride,
To bid the gentlefolk good-bye.
Unto the gates the servants fly
Leisurely through the gateway glides.
These take their seats; the coach of state
Where turmoil cannot penetrate,
"Adieu! thou home where peace abides,
Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
Shall I behold thee once again?”—
When to enlarge we shall succeed,
The limits of enlightenment
Will not five centuries exceed
In course of time (the whole extent
Our roads transformed the eye will strike;
By computation) it is like
And form a network left and right;
Highways all Russia will unite
Which o'er the waters boldly leap,
On iron bridges we shall gaze
Streams excavate subaqueous ways,
Mountains we'll level and through deep
An inn at every stage erect.
And Christian folk will, I expect,
Our bridges long neglected rot,
But now, what wretched roads one sees,
One moment's slumber suffer not.
And at the stages bugs and fleas
Meagre, within a draughty hut,
Inns there are none. Pretentious but
And irritates the appetite.
A bill of fare hangs full in sight
Before a fire which feebly glows
Meantime a Cyclops of those parts
The flimsy wares of Western marts,
Mends with the Russian hammer's blows
The ruts of his own fatherland.
With blessings on the ditches and
The journey in a sledge doth please,
Yet on a frosty winter day
Glides with a more luxurious ease;
No senseless fashionable lay
And our swift troikas never tire;
For our Automedons are fire
And like a palisade flit by.
The verst posts catch the vacant eye
From apprehension of the cost,
The Làrinas unwisely went,
So Tania to her heart's content
By their own horses, not the post—
Seven days and nights the travellers plod.
Could taste the pleasures of the road.
White Moscow raises her old spires,
But they draw near. Before them, lo!
As with innumerable fires.
Whose countless golden crosses glow
When I yon semicircle bright
Ah! brethren, what was my delight
Descried before me suddenly!
Of churches, gardens, belfries high
Condemned to exile dire by fate,
Moscow, how oft in evil days,
Moscow! How much is in the phrase
On thee I used to meditate!
How much is in that word expressed!
For every loyal Russian breast!
Petrovski Palace! Gloomily
Lo! compassed by his grove of oaks,
Here, drunk with his late victory,
His recent glory he invokes.
Moscow approach on bended knees,
Napoleon tarried till it please
Not so! My Moscow never went
Time-honoured Kremlin's keys present.
No gift she bears, no feast proclaims,
To seek him out with bended head.
For the impatient chief instead.
But lights incendiary flames
He on the conflagration frowned.
From hence engrossed in thought profound
Petrovski Palace; come, astir!
Adieu, thou witness of our glory,
Appear; along the road of Tver
Drive on! the city barriers hoary
Past women, sentry-boxes, rolls,
The coach is borne o'er ruts and holes,
Lamp-posts, shops, sledges, families,
Past palaces and nunneries,
Boulevards, belfries, milliners,
Bokharians, peasants, beds of greens,
And fashionable magazines,
Huts, chemists, Cossacks, shopkeepers
Jackdaws on every spire—in scores.
Balconies, lion's heads on doors,
An hour passed by—another—till,
The weary way still incomplete,
The coach before a house stood still.
Near Khariton's in a side street
Who had for four long years survived
At an old aunt's they had arrived
A Kalmuck gray, in caftan rent
An invalid from lung complaint.
And the saloon threw open wide;
And spectacles, his knitting staid
And the newcomers welcome bade.
The princess from the sofa cried
And exclamations interlaced.
The two old ladies then embraced
"Aline!”
"Princesse, mon ange!”—"Pachette!”—
Is it for long?”—"Ma chère cousine!”
"Who would have thought it? As of yore!
'Tis a scene of romance, I vow!”
"Sit down. How funny, to be sure!
"Ah! come, Tattiana, come to me!
"Tania, my eldest child, you know”—
Cousin, rememb'rest Grandison?”
Is it a dream, and can it be?
"What! Grandison?”—"Yes, certainly!”
"Oh! I remember, where is he?”—
"Here, he resides with Simeon.
He called upon me Christmas Eve—
His son is married, just conceive!”
"And he—but of him presently—
To-morrow Tania we will show,
What say you? to the family—
Alas! abroad I cannot go.
See, I can hardly crawl about—
But you must both be quite tired out!
Let us go seek a little rest—
Ah! I'm so weak—my throbbing breast!
Oppressive now is happiness,
Not only sorrow—Ah! my dear,
Now I am fit for nothing here.
In old age life is weariness!”
Then weeping she sank back distressed
And fits of coughing racked her chest.
By the sick lady's gaiety
And kindness Tania was impressed,
But, her own room in memory,
The strange apartment her oppressed:
Repose her silken curtains fled,
She could not sleep in her new bed.
The early tinkling of the bells
Which of approaching labour tells
Aroused Tattiana from her bed.
The maiden at her casement sits
As daylight glimmers, darkness flits,
But ah! discerns nor wood nor mead—
Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,
A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
To consanguineous dinners they
Conduct Tattiana constantly,
That grandmothers and grandsires may
Contemplate her sad reverie.
We Russians, friends from distant parts
Ever receive with kindly hearts
And exclamations and good cheer.
"How Tania grows! Doth it appear
Long since I held thee at the font—
Since in these arms I thee did bear—
And since I pulled thee by the ear—
And I to give thee cakes was wont?”—
Then the old dames in chorus sing,
"Oh! how our years are vanishing!”
But nothing changed in them is seen,
All in the good old style appears,
Our dear old aunt, Princess Helène,
Her cap of tulle still ever wears:
Luceria Lvovna paint applies,
Amy Petrovna  utters lies,
Ivan Petròvitch still a gaby,
Simeon Petròvitch just as shabby;
Pélagie Nikolavna has
Her friend Monsieur Finemouche the same,
Her wolf-dog and her husband tame;
Still of his club he member was—
As deaf and silly doth remain,
Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
Their daughters kiss Tattiana fair.
In the beginning, cold and mute,
Moscow's young Graces at her stare,
Examine her from head to foot.
They deem her somewhat finical,
Outlandish and provincial,
A trifle pale, a trifle lean,
But plainer girls they oft had seen.
Obedient then to Nature's law,
With her they did associate,
Squeeze tiny hands and osculate;
Her tresses curled in fashion saw,
And oft in whispers would impart
A maiden's secrets—of the heart.
Triumphs—their own or those of friends—
Hopes, frolics, dreams and sentiment
Their harmless conversation blends
With scandal's trivial ornament.
Then to reward such confidence
Her amorous experience
With mute appeal to ask they seem—
But Tania just as in a dream
Without participation hears,
Their voices nought to her impart
And the lone secret of her heart,
Her sacred hoard of joy and tears,
She buries deep within her breast
Nor aught confides unto the rest.
Tattiana would have gladly heard
The converse of the world polite,
But in the drawing-room all appeared
To find in gossip such delight,
Speech was so tame and colourless
Their slander e'en was weariness;
In their sterility of prattle,
Questions and news and tittle-tattle,
No sense was ever manifest
Though by an error and unsought—
The languid mind could smile at nought,
Heart would not throb albeit in jest—
Even amusing fools we miss
In thee, thou world of empty bliss.
In groups, official striplings glance
Conceitedly on Tania fair,
And views amongst themselves advance
Unfavourable unto her.
But one buffoon unhappy deemed
Her the ideal which he dreamed,
And leaning 'gainst the portal closed
To her an elegy composed.
Also one Viázemski, remarking
Tattiana by a poor aunt's side,
Successfully to please her tried,
And an old gent the poet marking
By Tania, smoothing his peruke,
To ask her name the trouble took.
But where Melpomene doth rave
With lengthened howl and accent loud,
And her bespangled robe doth wave
Before a cold indifferent crowd,
And where Thalia softly dreams
And heedless of approval seems,
Terpsichore alone among
Her sisterhood delights the young
(So 'twas with us in former years,
In your young days and also mine),
Never upon my heroine
The jealous dame her lorgnette veers,
The connoisseur his glances throws
From boxes or from stalls in rows.
To the assembly her they bear.
There the confusion, pressure, heat,
The crash of music, candles' glare
And rapid whirl of many feet,
The ladies' dresses airy, light,
The motley moving mass and bright,
Young ladies in a vasty curve,
To strike imagination serve.
'Tis there that arrant fops display
Their insolence and waistcoats white
And glasses unemployed all night;
Thither hussars on leave will stray
To clank the spur, delight the fair—
And vanish like a bird in air.
Full many a lovely star hath night
And Moscow many a beauty fair:
Yet clearer shines than every light
The moon in the blue atmosphere.
And she to whom my lyre would fain,
Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
Shines in the female firmament
Like a full moon magnificent.
Lo! with what pride celestial
Her feet the earth beneath her press!
Her heart how full of gentleness,
Her glance how wild yet genial!
Enough, enough, conclude thy lay—
For folly's dues thou hadst to pay.
Noise, laughter, bowing, hurrying mixt,
Gallop, mazurka, waltzing—see!
A pillar by, two aunts betwixt,
Tania, observed by nobody,
Looks upon all with absent gaze
And hates the world's discordant ways.
'Tis noisome to her there: in thought
Again her rural life she sought,
The hamlet, the poor villagers,
The little solitary nook
Where shining runs the tiny brook,
Her garden, and those books of hers,
And the lime alley's twilight dim
Where the first time she met with him.
Thus widely meditation erred,
Forgot the world, the noisy ball,
Whilst from her countenance ne'er stirred
The eyes of a grave general.
Both aunts looked knowing as a judge,
Each gave Tattiana's arm a nudge
And in a whisper did repeat:
"Look quickly to your left, my sweet!”
"The left? Why, what on earth is there?”—
"No matter, look immediately.
There, in that knot of company,
Two dressed in uniform appear—
Ah! he has gone the other way”—
"Who? Is it that stout general, pray?”—
Let us congratulations pay
To our Tattiana conquering,
And for a time our course delay,
That I forget not whom I sing.
Let me explain that in my song
"I celebrate a comrade young
And the extent of his caprice;
O epic Muse, my powers increase
And grant success to labour long;
Having a trusty staff bestowed,
Grant that I err not on the road.”
Enough! my pack is now unslung—
To classicism I've homage paid,
Though late, have a beginning made.
In the Lyceum's noiseless shade
As in a garden when I grew,
I Apuleius gladly read
But would not look at Cicero.
'Twas then in valleys lone, remote,
In spring-time, heard the cygnet's note
By waters shining tranquilly,
That first the Muse appeared to me.
Into the study of the boy
There came a sudden flash of light,
The Muse revealed her first delight,
Sang childhood's pastimes and its joy,
Glory with which our history teems
And the heart's agitated dreams.
And the world met her smilingly,
A first success light pinions gave,
The old Derjavine noticed me,
And blest me, sinking to the grave.
Then my companions young with pleasure
In the unfettered hours of leisure
Her utterances ever heard,
And by a partial temper stirred
And boiling o'er with friendly heat,
They first of all my brow did wreathe
And an encouragement did breathe
That my coy Muse might sing more sweet.
O triumphs of my guileless days,
How sweet a dream your memories raise!
Passion's wild sway I then allowed,
Her promptings unto law did make,
Pursuits I followed of the crowd,
My sportive Muse I used to take
To many a noisy feast and fight,
Terror of guardians of the night;
And wild festivities among
She brought with her the gift of song.
Like a Bacchante in her sport
Beside the cup she sang her rhymes
And the young revellers of past times
Vociferously paid her court,
And I, amid the friendly crowd,
Of my light paramour was proud.
But I abandoned their array,
And fled afar—she followed me.
How oft the kindly Muse away
Hath whiled the road's monotony,
Entranced me by some mystic tale.
How oft beneath the moonbeams pale
Like Leonora did she ride
With me Caucasian rocks beside!
How oft to the Crimean shore
She led me through nocturnal mist
Unto the sounding sea to list,
Where Nereids murmur evermore,
And where the billows hoarsely raise
To God eternal hymns of praise.
Then, the far capital forgot,
Its splendour and its blandishments,
In poor Moldavia cast her lot,
She visited the humble tents
Of migratory gipsy hordes—
And wild among them grew her words—
Our godlike tongue she could exchange
For savage speech, uncouth and strange,
And ditties of the steppe she loved.
But suddenly all changed around!
Lo! in my garden was she found
And as a country damsel roved,
A pensive sorrow in her glance
And in her hand a French romance.
Now for the first time I my Muse
Lead into good society,
Her steppe-like beauties I peruse
With jealous fear, anxiety.
Through dense aristocratic rows
Of diplomats and warlike beaux
And supercilious dames she glides,
Sits down and gazes on all sides—
Amazed at the confusing crowd,
Variety of speech and vests,
Deliberate approach of guests
Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
And the dark fringe of men, like frames
Enclosing pictures of fair dames.
Assemblies oligarchical
Please her by their decorum fixed,
The rigour of cold pride and all
Titles and ages intermixed.
But who in that choice company
With clouded brow stands silently?
Unknown to all he doth appear,
A vision desolate and drear
Doth seem to him the festal scene.
Doth his brow wretchedness declare
Or suffering pride? Why is he there?
Who may he be? Is it Eugene?
Pray is it he? It is the same.
"And is it long since back he came?
"Is he the same or grown more wise?
Still doth the misanthrope appear?
He has returned, say in what guise?
What is his latest character?
What doth he act? Is it Melmoth,
Philanthropist or patriot,
Childe Harold, quaker, devotee,
Or other mask donned playfully?
Or a good fellow for the nonce,
Like you and me and all the rest?—
But this is my advice, 'twere best
Not to behave as he did once—
Society he duped enow.”
"Is he known to you?”—"Yes and No.”
Wherefore regarding him express
Perverse, unfavourable views?
Is it that human restlessness
For ever carps, condemns, pursues?
Is it that ardent souls of flame
By recklessness amuse or shame
Selfish nonentities around?
That mind which yearns for space is bound?
And that too often we receive
Professions eagerly for deeds,
That crass stupidity misleads,
That we by cant ourselves deceive,
That mediocrity alone
Without disgust we look upon?
Happy he who in youth was young,
Happy who timely grew mature,
He who life's frosts which early wrung
Hath gradually learnt to endure;
By visions who was ne'er deranged
Nor from the mob polite estranged,
At twenty who was prig or swell,
At thirty who was married well,
At fifty who relief obtained
From public and from private ties,
Who glory, wealth and dignities
Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
And unto whom we all allude
As to a worthy man and good!
But sad is the reflection made,
In vain was youth by us received,
That we her constantly betrayed
And she at last hath us deceived;
That our desires which noblest seemed,
The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
Have one by one all withered grown
Like rotten leaves by Autumn strown—
'Tis fearful to anticipate
Nought but of dinners a long row,
To look on life as on a show,
Eternally to imitate
The seemly crowd, partaking nought
Its passions and its modes of thought.
The butt of scandal having been,
'Tis dreadful—ye agree, I hope—
To pass with reasonable men
For a fictitious misanthrope,
A visionary mortified,
Or monster of Satanic pride,
Or e'en the "Demon” of my strain.
Onéguine—take him up again—
In duel having killed his friend
And reached, with nought his mind to engage,
The twenty-sixth year of his age,
Wearied of leisure in the end,
Without profession, business, wife,
He knew not how to spend his life.
Him a disquietude did seize,
A wish from place to place to roam,
A very troublesome disease,
In some a willing martyrdom.
Abandoned he his country seat,
Of woods and fields the calm retreat,
Where every day before his eyes
A blood-bespattered shade would rise,
And aimless journeys did commence—
But still remembrance to him clings,
His travels like all other things
Inspired but weariness intense;
Returning, from his ship amid
A ball he fell as Tchatzki did.
Behold, the crowd begins to stir,
A whisper runs along the hall,
A lady draws the hostess near,
Behind her a grave general.
Her manners were deliberate,
Reserved, but not inanimate,
Her eyes no saucy glance address,
There was no angling for success.
Her features no grimaces bleared;
Of affectation innocent,
Calm and without embarrassment,
A faithful model she appeared
Of "comme il faut.” Shishkòff, forgive!
I can't translate the adjective.
Ladies in crowds around her close,
Her with a smile old women greet,
The men salute with lower bows
And watch her eye's full glance to meet.
Maidens before her meekly move
Along the hall, and high above
The crowd doth head and shoulders rise
The general who accompanies.
None could her beautiful declare,
Yet viewing her from head to foot,
None could a trace of that impute,
Which in the elevated sphere
Of London life is "vulgar” called
And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.
I like this word exceedingly
Although it will not bear translation,
With us 'tis quite a novelty
Not high in general estimation;
'Twould serve ye in an epigram—
But turn we once more to our dame.
Enchanting, but unwittingly,
At table she was sitting by
The brilliant Nina Voronskoi,
The Neva's Cleopatra, and
None the conviction could withstand
That Nina's marble symmetry,
Though dazzling its effulgence white,
Could not eclipse her neighbour's light.
"And is it,” meditates Eugene.
"And is it she? It must be—no—
How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”—
And the eternal lorgnette through
Frequent and rapid doth his glance
Seek the forgotten countenance
Familiar to him long ago.
"Inform me, prince, pray dost thou know
The lady in the crimson cap
Who with the Spanish envoy speaks?”—
The prince's eye Onéguine seeks:
"Ah! long the world hath missed thy shape!
But stop! I will present thee, if
You choose.”—"But who is she?”—"My wife.”
"So thou art wed! I did not know.
Long ago?”—"'Tis the second year.”
"To—?”—"Làrina.”—"Tattiana?”—"So.
And dost thou know her?”—"We live near.”
"Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
His wife approaches, with him leads
His relative and friend as well.
The lady's glance upon him fell—
And though her soul might be confused,
And vehemently though amazed
She on the apparition gazed,
No signs of trouble her accused,
A mien unaltered she preserved,
Her bow was easy, unreserved.
Ah no! no faintness her attacked
Nor sudden turned she red or white,
Her brow she did not e'en contract
Nor yet her lip compressed did bite.
Though he surveyed her at his ease,
Not the least trace Onéguine sees
Of the Tattiana of times fled.
He conversation would have led—
But could not. Then she questioned him:—
"Had he been long here, and where from?
Straight from their province had he come?”—
Cast upwards then her eyeballs dim
Unto her husband, went away—
Transfixed Onéguine mine doth stay.
Is this the same Tattiana, say,
Before whom once in solitude,
In the beginning of this lay,
Deep in the distant province rude,
Impelled by zeal for moral worth,
He salutary rules poured forth?
The maid whose note he still possessed
Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
Where all upon the surface lies,—
That girl—but he must dreaming be—
That girl whom once on a time he
Could in a humble sphere despise,
Can she have been a moment gone
Thus haughty, careless in her tone?
He quits the fashionable throng
And meditative homeward goes,
Visions, now sad, now grateful, long
Do agitate his late repose.
He wakes—they with a letter come—
The Princess N. will be at home
On such a day. O Heavens, 'tis she!
Oh! I accept. And instantly
He a polite reply doth scrawl.
What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
In the recesses what hath stirred
Of a heart cold and cynical?
Vexation? Vanity? or strove
Again the plague of boyhood—love?
The hours once more Onéguine counts,
Impatient waits the close of day,
But ten strikes and his sledge he mounts
And gallops to her house away.
Trembling he seeks the young princess—
Tattiana finds in loneliness.
Together moments one or two
They sat, but conversation's flow
Deserted Eugene. He, distraught,
Sits by her gloomily, desponds,
Scarce to her questions he responds,
Full of exasperating thought.
He fixedly upon her stares—
She calm and unconcerned appears.
The husband comes and interferes
With this unpleasant tête-à-tête,
With Eugene pranks of former years
And jests doth recapitulate.
They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
The conversation was revived
By the coarse wit of worldly hate;
But round the hostess scintillate
Light sallies without coxcombry,
Awhile sound conversation seems
To banish far unworthy themes
And platitudes and pedantry,
And never was the ear affright
By liberties or loose or light.
And yet the city's flower was there,
Noblesse and models of the mode,
Faces which we meet everywhere
And necessary fools allowed.
Behold the dames who once were fine
With roses, caps and looks malign;
Some marriageable maids behold,
Blank, unapproachable and cold.
Lo, the ambassador who speaks
Economy political,
And with gray hair ambrosial
The old man who has had his freaks,
Renowned for his acumen, wit,
But now ridiculous a bit.
Behold Sabouroff, whom the age
For baseness of the spirit scorns,
Saint Priest, who every album's page
With blunted pencil-point adorns.
Another tribune of the ball
Hung like a print against the wall,
Pink as Palm Sunday cherubim,
Motionless, mute, tight-laced and trim.
The traveller, bird of passage he,
Stiff, overstarched and insolent,
Awakens secret merriment
By his embarrassed dignity—
Mute glances interchanged aside
Meet punishment for him provide.
But my Onéguine the whole eve
Within his mind Tattiana bore,
Not the young timid maid, believe,
Enamoured, simple-minded, poor,
But the indifferent princess,
Divinity without access
Of the imperial Neva's shore.
O Men, how very like ye are
To Eve the universal mother,
Possession hath no power to please,
The serpent to unlawful trees
Aye bids ye in some way or other—
Unless forbidden fruit we eat,
Our paradise is no more sweet.
Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
How thoroughly her part she took!
How soon to habits she conformed
Which crushing dignity must brook!
Who would the maiden innocent
In the unmoved, magnificent
Autocrat of the drawing-room seek?
And he had made her heart beat quick!
'Twas he whom, amid nightly shades,
Whilst Morpheus his approach delays,
She mourned and to the moon would raise
The languid eye of love-sick maids,
Dreaming perchance in weal or woe
To end with him her path below.
To Love all ages lowly bend,
But the young unpolluted heart
His gusts should fertilize, amend,
As vernal storms the fields athwart.
Youth freshens beneath Passion's showers,
Develops and matures its powers,
And thus in season the rich field
Gay flowers and luscious fruit doth yield.
But at a later, sterile age,
The solstice of our earthly years,
Mournful Love's deadly trace appears
As storms which in chill autumn rage
And leave a marsh the fertile ground
And devastate the woods around.
There was no doubt! Eugene, alas!
Tattiana loved as when a lad,
Both day and night he now must pass
In love-lorn meditation sad.
Careless of every social rule,
The crystals of her vestibule
He daily in his drives drew near
And like a shadow haunted her.
Enraptured was he if allowed
To swathe her shoulders in the furs,
If his hot hand encountered hers,
Or he dispersed the motley crowd
Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
She seemed of him oblivious,
Despite the anguish of his breast,
Received him freely at her house,
At times three words to him addressed
In company, or simply bowed,
Or recognized not in the crowd.
No coquetry was there, I vouch—
Society endures not such!
Onéguine's cheek grew ashy pale,
Either she saw not or ignored;
Onéguine wasted; on my word,
Already he grew phthisical.
All to the doctors Eugene send,
And they the waters recommend.
He went not—sooner was prepared
To write his forefathers to warn
Of his approach; but nothing cared
Tattiana—thus the sex is born.—
He obstinately will remain,
Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
Sickness more courage doth command
Than health, so with a trembling hand
A love epistle he doth scrawl.
Though correspondence as a rule
He used to hate—and was no fool—
Yet suffering emotional
Had rendered him an invalid;
But word for word his letter read.
Onéguine's Letter to Tattiana
All is foreseen. My secret drear
Will sound an insult in your ear.
What acrimonious scorn I trace
Depicted on your haughty face!
What do I ask? What cause assigned
That I to you reveal my mind?
To what malicious merriment,
It may be, I yield nutriment!
Meeting you in times past by chance,
Warmth I imagined in your glance,
But, knowing not the actual truth,
Restrained the impulses of youth;
Also my wretched liberty
I would not part with finally;
This separated us as well—
Lenski, unhappy victim, fell,
From everything the heart held dear
I then resolved my heart to tear;
Unknown to all, without a tie,
I thought—retirement, liberty,
Will happiness replace. My God!
How I have erred and felt the rod!
No, ever to behold your face,
To follow you in every place,
Your smiling lips, your beaming eyes,
To watch with lovers' ecstasies,
Long listen, comprehend the whole
Of your perfections in my soul,
Before you agonized to die—
This, this were true felicity!
But such is not for me. I brood
Daily of love in solitude.
My days of life approach their end,
Yet I in idleness expend
The remnant destiny concedes,
And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
I feel, allotted is my span;
But, that life longer may remain,
At morn I must assuredly
Know that thy face that day I see.
I tremble lest my humble prayer
You with stern countenance declare
The artifice of villany—
I hear your harsh, reproachful cry.
If ye but knew how dreadful 'tis
To bear love's parching agonies—
To burn, yet reason keep awake
The fever of the blood to slake—
A passionate desire to bend
And, sobbing at your feet, to blend
Entreaties, woes and prayers, confess
All that the heart would fain express—
Yet with a feigned frigidity
To arm the tongue and e'en the eye,
To be in conversation clear
And happy unto you appear.
So be it! But internal strife
I cannot longer wage concealed.
The die is cast! Thine is my life!
Into thy hands my fate I yield!
No answer! He another sent.
Epistle second, note the third,
Remained unnoticed. Once he went
To an assembly—she appeared
Just as he entered. How severe!
She will not see, she will not hear.
Alas! she is as hard, behold,
And frosty as a Twelfth Night cold.
Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
The indignation of her heart!
A sidelong look doth Eugene dart:
Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
Where, where, the trace of tears? None, none!
Upon her brow sits wrath alone—
And it may be a secret dread
Lest the world or her lord divine
A certain little escapade
Well known unto Onéguine mine.
'Tis hopeless! Homeward doth he flee
Cursing his own stupidity,
And brooding o'er the ills he bore,
Society renounced once more.
Then in the silent cabinet
He in imagination saw
The time when Melancholy's claw
'Mid worldly pleasures chased him yet,
Caught him and by the collar took
And shut him in a lonely nook.
He read as vainly as before,
Perusing Gibbon and Rousseau,
Manzoni, Herder and Chamfort,
Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot:
He read the unbelieving Bayle,
Also the works of Fontenelle,
Some Russian authors he perused—
Nought in the universe refused:
Nor almanacs nor newspapers,
Which lessons unto us repeat,
Wherein I castigation get;
And where a madrigal occurs
Writ in my honour now and then—
E sempre bene, gentlemen!
But what results? His eyes peruse
But thoughts meander far away—
Ideas, desires and woes confuse
His intellect in close array.
His eyes, the printed lines betwixt,
On lines invisible are fixt;
'Twas these he read and these alone
His spirit was intent upon.
They were the wonderful traditions
Of kindly, dim antiquity,
Dreams with no continuity,
Prophecies, threats and apparitions,
The lively trash of stories long
Or letters of a maiden young.
And by degrees upon him grew
A lethargy of sense, a trance,
And soon imagination threw
Before him her wild game of chance.
And now upon the snow in thaw
A young man motionless he saw,
As one who bivouacs afield,
And heard a voice cry—Why! He's killed!—
And now he views forgotten foes,
Poltroons and men of slanderous tongue,
Bevies of treacherous maidens young;
Of thankless friends the circle rose,
A mansion—by the window, see!
She sits alone—'tis ever she!
So frequently his mind would stray
He well-nigh lost the use of sense,
Almost became a poet say—
Oh! what had been his eminence!
Indeed, by force of magnetism
A Russian poem's mechanism
My scholar without aptitude
At this time almost understood.
How like a poet was my chum
When, sitting by his fire alone
Whilst cheerily the embers shone,
He "Benedetta” used to hum,
Or "Idol mio,” and in the grate
Would lose his slippers or gazette.
Time flies! a genial air abroad,
Winter resigned her empire white,
Onéguine ne'er as poet showed
Nor died nor lost his senses quite.
Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
His chambers close wherein confined
He marmot-like did hibernate,
His double sashes and his grate,
And sallied forth one brilliant morn—
Along the Neva's bank he sleighs,
On the blue blocks of ice the rays
Of the sun glisten; muddy, worn,
The snow upon the streets doth melt—
Whither along them doth he pelt?
Onéguine whither gallops? Ye
Have guessed already. Yes, quite so!
Unto his own Tattiana he,
Incorrigible rogue, doth go.
Her house he enters, ghastly white,
The vestibule finds empty quite—
He enters the saloon. 'Tis blank!
A door he opens. But why shrank
He back as from a sudden blow?—
Alone the princess sitteth there,
Pallid and with dishevelled hair,
Gazing upon a note below.
Her tears flow plentifully and
Her cheek reclines upon her hand.
Oh! who her speechless agonies
Could not in that brief moment guess!
Who now could fail to recognize
Tattiana in the young princess!
Tortured by pangs of wild regret,
Eugene fell prostrate at her feet—
She starts, nor doth a word express,
But gazes on Onéguine's face
Without amaze or wrath displayed:
His sunken eye and aspect faint,
Imploring looks and mute complaint
She comprehends. The simple maid
By fond illusions once possest
Is once again made manifest.
His kneeling posture he retains—
Calmly her eyes encounter his—
Insensible her hand remains
Beneath his lips' devouring kiss.
What visions then her fancy thronged—
A breathless silence then, prolonged—
But finally she softly said:
"Enough, arise! for much we need
Without disguise ourselves explain.
Onéguine, hast forgotten yet
The hour when—Fate so willed—we met
In the lone garden and the lane?
How meekly then I heard you preach—
To-day it is my turn to teach.
"Onéguine, I was younger then,
And better, if I judge aright;
I loved you—what did I obtain?
Affection how did you requite?
But with austerity!—for you
No novelty—is it not true?—
Was the meek love a maiden feels.
But now—my very blood congeals,
Calling to mind your icy look
And sermon—but in that dread hour
I blame not your behaviour—
An honourable course ye took,
Displayed a noble rectitude—
My soul is filled with gratitude!
"Then, in the country, is't not true?
And far removed from rumour vain;
I did not please you. Why pursue
Me now, inflict upon me pain?—
Wherefore am I your quarry held?—
Is it that I am now compelled
To move in fashionable life,
That I am rich, a prince's wife?—
Because my lord, in battles maimed,
Is petted by the Emperor?—
That my dishonour would ensure
A notoriety proclaimed,
And in society might shed
A bastard fame prohibited?
"I weep. And if within your breast
My image hath not disappeared,
Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
Your conversation cold and hard,
If the choice in my power were,
To lawless love I should prefer—
And to these letters and these tears.
For visions of my childish years
Then ye were barely generous,
Age immature averse to cheat—
But now—what brings you to my feet?—
How mean, how pusillanimous!
A prudent man like you and brave
To shallow sentiment a slave!
"Onéguine, all this sumptuousness,
The gilding of life's vanities,
In the world's vortex my success,
My splendid house and gaieties—
What are they? Gladly would I yield
This life in masquerade concealed,
This glitter, riot, emptiness,
For my wild garden and bookcase,—
Yes! for our unpretending home,
Onéguine—the beloved place
Where the first time I saw your face,—
Or for the solitary tomb
Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
Beneath a cross and shrubbery.
"'Twas possible then, happiness—
Nay, near—but destiny decreed—
My lot is fixed—with thoughtlessness
It may be that I did proceed—
With bitter tears my mother prayed,
And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
Indifferent was her future fate.
I married—now, I supplicate—
For ever your Tattiana leave.
Your heart possesses, I know well,
Honour and pride inflexible.
I love you—to what end deceive?—
But I am now another's bride—
For ever faithful will abide.”
She rose—departed. But Eugene
Stood as if struck by lightning fire.
What a storm of emotions keen
Raged round him and of balked desire!
And hark! the clank of spurs is heard
And Tania's husband soon appeared.—
But now our hero we must leave
Just at a moment which I grieve
Must be pronounced unfortunate—
For long—for ever. To be sure
Together we have wandered o'er
The world enough. Congratulate
Each other as the shore we climb!
Hurrah! it long ago was time!
Reader, whoever thou mayst be,
Foeman or friend, I do aspire
To part in amity with thee!
Adieu! whate'er thou didst desire
From careless stanzas such as these,
Of passion reminiscences,
Pictures of the amusing scene,
Repose from labour, satire keen,
Or faults of grammar on its page—
God grant that all who herein glance,
In serious mood or dalliance
Or in a squabble to engage,
May find a crumb to satisfy.
Now we must separate. Good-bye!
And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
Thou also, my ideal true,
And thou, persistent to the end,
My little book. With thee I knew
All that a poet could desire,
Oblivion of life's tempest dire,
Of friends the grateful intercourse—
Oh, many a year hath run its course
Since I beheld Eugene and young
Tattiana in a misty dream,
And my romance's open theme
Glittered in a perspective long,
And I discerned through Fancy's prism
Distinctly not its mechanism.
But ye to whom, when friendship heard,
The first-fruits of my tale I read,
As Saadi anciently averred—
Some are afar and some are dead.
Without them Eugene is complete;
And thou, from whom Tattiana sweet;
Was drawn, ideal of my lay—
Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
Happy who quit life's banquet seat
Before the dregs they shall divine
Of the cup brimming o'er with wine—
Who the romance do not complete,
But who abandon it—as I
Have my Onéguine—suddenly.
